    A YANG Model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring
                draft-ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm-01

Abstract

   The data model defined in RFC 8345 introduces vertical layering
   relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover network
   and service topologies.  This document defines a YANG module for both
   network performance monitoring (PM) and VPN service performance
   monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage network performance
   on the topology at higher layer or the service topology between VPN
   sites.

   The YANG model defined in this document is designed as an
   augmentation to the network topology YANG model defined in RFC 8345
   and draws on relevant YANG types defined in RFC 6991, RFC 8299, RFC
   8345, and RFC 8532.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8969] describes a framework for automating service and network
   management with YANG models, proposing the performance measurement
   telemetry model to be tied with the service, such as Layer 3 VPN and

   Layer 2 VPN, or network models to monitor the overall network
   performance or Service Level Agreements (SLA).

   This document defines a YANG module [RFC7950] for both network
   performance monitoring and VPN service performance monitoring.  This
   module can be used to monitor and manage network performance on the
   topology level or the service topology between VPN sites, in
   particular.

   This document does not introduce new metrics for network performance
   or mechanisms for measuring network performance, but uses the
   existing mechanisms and statistics to show the performance monitoring
   statistics at the network and service layers.  The YANG module
   defined in this document is designed as an augmentation to the
   network topology YANG model defined in [RFC8345].

   This document uses the common VPN YANG module defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   Appendix A provides a set of examples to illustrate the use of the
   module.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring Model Usage

   Models are key for automating network management operations.
   According to [RFC8969], together with service and network models,
   performance measurement telemetry models are needed to monitor
   network performance to meet specific service requirements (typically
   captured in an SLA).  The YANG module defined in this document is
   designed to derive VPN or network level performance data based on
   lower-level data collected via monitoring counters of the involved
   devices.

                     Figure 1: Reference Architecture

   As shown in Figure 1, in the context of layering model architecture
   described in [RFC8309], the network and VPN service performance
   monitoring (PM) model can be used to expose some performance
   information to the above layer.  Such an information can be used by
   an orchestrator to subscribe to performance data.  The network
   controller will then notify the orchestrator about corresponding
   parameter changes.

   Before using the network and VPN service PM model, the mapping
   between the VPN service topology and the underlying physical network
   should be setup.  Also, the performance monitoring data per link in
   the underlying network can be collected using network performance
   measurement method such as MPLS Loss and Delay Measurement [RFC6374].

   The performance monitoring information reflecting the quality of the
   network or VPN service (e.g., end to end network performance data
   between source node and destination node in the network or between
   VPN sites) can be computed and aggregated, for example, the
   information from Traffic Engineering Database (TED), defined in
   [RFC7471], [RFC8570], or [RFC8571] or LMAP [RFC8194].

   The measurement and report intervals that are associated with these
   performance data usually depend on the configuration parameters.

3.1.  Collecting Data via Pub/Sub Mechanism

   Some applications such as service-assurance applications, which must
   maintain a continuous view of operational data and state, can use the
   subscription model [RFC8641] to subscribe to the specific network
   performance data or VPN service performance data they are interested
   in, at the data source.

   The data source can, then, use the network and VPN service assurance
   model defined in this document and the YANG Push model [RFC8641] to
   distribute specific telemetry data to target recipients.

3.2.  Collecting Data via Retrieval Methods

   To obtain a snapshot of a large amount of performance data from a
   network element (including network controllers), service-assurance
   applications may use methods such as retrieving performance data or
   RPC commands defined as part of YANG models.

4.  Description of The Data Model

   This document defines the YANG module, "ietf-network-vpn-pm", which
   is an augmentation to the "ietf-network" and "ietf-network-topology".

   The performance monitoring data augments the service topology as
   shown in Figure 2.

4.1.  Layering Relationship between Multiple Layers of Topology

   [RFC8345] defines a YANG data model for network/service topologies
   and inventories.  The service topology described in [RFC8345]
   includes the virtual topology for a service layer above Layer 1 (L1),
   Layer 2 (L2), and Layer 3 (L3).  This service topology has the
   generic topology elements of node, link, and terminating point.  One
   typical example of a service topology is described in Figure 3 of
   [RFC8345]: two VPN service topologies instantiated over a common L3
   topology.  Each VPN service topology is mapped onto a subset of nodes
   from the common L3 topology.

    Figure 3: Example of Topology Mapping Between VPN Service Topology
                          and Underlying Network

   As shown in Figure 3, two VPN services topologies are both built on
   top of one common underlying physical network:

   VPN 1:   This service topology supports hub-spoke communications for
      'customer 1' connecting the customer's access at three sites:
      'Site-1A', 'Site-1B', and 'Site-1C'.  These sites are connected to
      nodes that are mapped to node 1 (N1), node 2 (N2), and node 4 (N4)
      in the underlying physical network.  'Site-1A' plays the role of
      hub while 'Site-1B' and 'Site-1C' are configured as spoke.

   VPN 2:   This service supports any-to-any communications for
      'customer 2' connecting the customer's access at two sites: 'Site-
      2A' and 'Site-2B'.  These sites are connected to nodes that are
      mapped to nodes 1 (N1) and node 3 (N3)5 in the underlying physical
      network.  'Site-2A' and 'Site-2B' have 'any-to-any' role.

4.2.  Network Level

   For network performance monitoring, the container of "ietf-network"
   do not need to be extended.

   For VPN service performance monitoring, the container "service-type"
   is defined to indicate the VPN type, e.g., L3VPN or Virtual Private
   LAN Service (VPLS).  The values are taken from
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  When a network topology instance
   contains the L3VPN or other L2VPN network type, it represents a VPN
   instance that can perform performance monitoring.

   This model defines the following set of network level attributes:

   "vpn-id":  Refers to an identifier of VPN service defined in
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common]).  This identifier is used to
      correlate the performance status with the network service
      configuration.

   "vpn-service-topology":  Indicates the type of VPN topology.  This
      model supports "any-to-any", "Hub and Spoke" (where Hubs can
      exchange traffic), and "Hub and Spoke disjoint" (where Hubs cannot
      exchange traffic) that are taken from
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  These VPN topology types can be
      used to describe how VPN sites communicate with each other.

4.3.  Node Level

   For network performance monitoring, the attributes of "Node Level"
   that are defined in [RFC8345] do not need to be extended.

   For VPN service performance monitoring, this model defines only the
   following minimal set of Node level network topology attributes:

   "node-type":  Indicates the type of the node, such as Provider Edge
      (PE) or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).  This "node-type"

      can be used to report performance metric between any two nodes
      each with specific node-type.

   "role":  Defines the role in a particular VPN service topology.  The
      roles are taken from [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] (e.g., any-to-
      any-role, spoke-role, hub-role).

   "vpn-summary-statistics":  Lists a set of IPv4 statistics, IPv6
      statistics, and MAC statistics.  These statistics are specified
      separately.

               Figure 5: Node Level View of the Hierarchies

4.4.  Link and Termination Point Level

   The 'links' are classified into two types: topology link defined in
   [RFC8345] and abstract link of a VPN between PEs.

   The performance data of a link is a collection of counters that
   report the performance status.  The data for the topology link can be
   based, e.g., on BGP-LS [RFC8571].  The statistics of the VPN abstract
   links can be collected based upon VPN OAM mechanisms, e.g., Two-way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357].  Alternatively, the
   data can be based upon the underlay technology OAM mechanisms, for
   example, GRE tunnel OAM.

   The customer sites are connected to the 'vpn-network-accesses'.

   For the data nodes of 'link' depicted in Figure 6, the YANG module
   defines the following minimal set of link-level performance
   attributes:

   Percentile parameters:  The module supports reporting delay and
      jitter metric by percentile values.  By default, low percentile
      (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th percentile), high
      percentile (90th percentile) are used.  Setting a percentile into
      0.00 indicates the client is not interested in receiving
      particular percentile.  If all percentile nodes are set to 0.00,
      this represents that no percentile related nodes will be reported
      for a given performance metric (e.g. one-way delay, one-way delay
      variation) and only peak/min values will be reported.  For
      example, a client can inform the server that it is interested in
      receiving only high percentiles.  Then for a given link, at a
      given "reference-time" "measurement-interval", the 'high-delay-
      percentile' and 'high-jitter-percentile' will be reported.  An
      example to illustrate the use of percentiles is provided in
      Appendix A.3.

   Loss Statistics:  A set of loss statistics attributes that are used
      to measure end to end loss between VPN sites or between any two
      network nodes.  The exact loss value or the loss percentage can be
      reported.

   Delay Statistics:  A set of delay statistics attributes that are used
      to measure end to end latency between VPN sites or between any two
      network nodes.  The peak/min values or percentile values can be
      reported.

   Jitter Statistics:   A set of IP Packet Delay Variation [RFC3393]
      statistics attributes that are used to measure end to end jitter
      between VPN sites or between any two network nodes.  The peak/min
      values or percentile values can be reported.

   "protocol-type":  Indicates the abstract link protocol-type of a VPN,
      such as GRE or IP-in-IP.  The leaf refers to an identifier of the
      "underlay-transport" defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common],
      which describes the transport technology to carry the traffic of
      the VPN service.

   For the data nodes of 'termination-point' depicted inFigure 6, the
   module defines the following minimal set of statistics:

   Inbound statistics:  A set of inbound statistics attributes that are
      used to measure the inbound statistics of the termination point,
      such as received packets, received packets with errors, etc.

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG           July 2021


   Outbound statistics:  A set of outbound statistics attributes that
      are used to measure the outbound statistics of the termination
      point, such as sent packets, packets that could not be sent due to
      errors, etc.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see
   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH)[RFC6242] .  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/svc-topo:svc-telemetry-attributes

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/svc-topo:node-attributes

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-vpn-pm
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

Appendix A.  Illustrating Examples

A.1.  Example of Pub/Sub Retrieval

   The example shown in Figure 7 illustrates how a client subscribes to
   the performance monitoring information between nodes ('node-id') A
   and B in the L3 network topology.  The performance monitoring
   parameter that the client is interested in is end-to-end loss.

A.2.  Example of RPC-based Retrieval

   This example, depicted in Figure 8, illustrates how a the client can
   use the RPC model to fetch performance data on demand.  For example,
   the client requests "packet-loss-count" between 'source-node' A and
   'dest-node' B that belong to the same VPN ('VPN1').
