L3NM:
 
Juniper Networks has a prototype implementation of the IETF L3NM model. It takes as its input an instance of the L3SM (RFC8299) and from that populates an L3NM instance, taking diversity requirements into account. Alternatively an instance of the L3NM can be provided as input. Transformation from the L3NM instance to device configuration then occurs.Capabilities supported include any-to-any and hub-and-spoke VPNs, with a choice of BGP, OSPF or static as the PE-CE protocol.
