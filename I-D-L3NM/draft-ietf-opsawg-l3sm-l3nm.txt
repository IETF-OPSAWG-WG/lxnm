                    A Layer 3 VPN Network YANG Model
                     draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-10

Abstract

   This document defines an L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) that can be
   used for the provisioning of Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   services within a service provider network.  The model provides a
   network-centric view of L3VPN services.

   L3NM is meant to be used by a network controller to derive the
   configuration information that will be sent to relevant network
   devices.  The model can also facilitate the communication between a
   service orchestrator and a network controller/orchestrator.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8299] defines a Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service YANG data
   Model (L3SM) that can be used for communication between customers and
   network operators.  Such a model focuses on describing the customer
   view of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) services and provides an
   abstracted view of the customer's requested services.  That approach
   limits the usage of the L3SM to the role of a customer service model
   (as per [RFC8309]).

   This document defines a YANG module called L3VPN Network Model
   (L3NM).  The L3NM is aimed at providing a network-centric view of
   Layer 3 (L3) VPN services.  This data model can be used to facilitate
   communication between the service orchestrator and the network
   controller/orchestrator by allowing for more network-centric
   information to be included.  It enables further capabilities such as
   resource management or serves as a multi-domain orchestration
   interface, where logical resources (such as route targets or route
   distinguishers) must be coordinated.

   This document uses the common VPN YANG module defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   This document does not obsolete [RFC8299].  These two modules are
   used for similar objectives but with different scopes and views.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


   The L3NM YANG module was initially built with a prune and extend
   approach, taking as a starting points the YANG module described in
   [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, the L3NM is not defined as an augment to
   L3SM because a specific structure is required to meet network-
   oriented L3 needs.

   Some information captured in the L3SM can be passed by the
   orchestrator in the L3NM (e.g., customer) or be used to feed some
   L3NM attributes (e.g., actual forwarding policies).  Also, some
   information captured in the L3SM may be maintained locally within the
   orchestrator; which is in charge of maintaining the correspondence
   between a customer view and its network instantiation.  Likewise,
   some information captured and exposed using the L3NM can feed the
   service layer (e.g., capabilities) to drive VPN service order
   handling, and thus the L3SM.

   Section 5.1 of [RFC8969] illustrates how the L3NM can be used within
   the network management automation architecture.

   The L3NM does not attempt to address all deployment cases, especially
   those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported through the
   coordination of different VPNs in different underlying networks.
   More complex deployment scenarios involving the coordination of
   different VPN instances and different technologies to provide an end-
   to-end VPN connectivity are addressed by complementary YANG modules,
   e.g., [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].

   The L3NM focuses on BGP Provider Edge (PE) based Layer 3 VPNs as
   described in [RFC4026][RFC4110][RFC4364] and Multicast VPNs as
   described in [RFC6037][RFC6513].

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8299], [RFC8309], and [RFC8453] and uses
   the terminology defined in those documents.

   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


   The meaning of the symbols in the tree diagrams is defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Layer 3 VPN Customer Service Model (L3SM):  A YANG module that
      describes the service requirements of an L3VPN that interconnects
      a set of sites from the point of view of the customer.  The
      customer service model does not provide details on the service
      provider network.  The L3VPN customer service model is defined in
      [RFC8299].

   Layer 3 VPN Service Network Model (L3NM):  A YANG module that
      describes a VPN service in the service provider network.  It
      contains information of the service provider network and might
      include allocated resources.  It can be used by network
      controllers to manage and control the VPN service configuration in
      the service provider network.  The YANG module can be consumed by
      a service orchestrator to request a VPN service to a network
      controller.

   Service orchestrator:  A functional entity that interacts with the
      customer of an L3VPN.  The service orchestrator interacts with the
      customer using the L3SM.  The service orchestrator is responsible
      for the Customer Edge (CE) - Provider Edge (PE) attachment
      circuits, the PE selection, and requesting the VPN service to the
      network controller.

   Network orchestrator:  A functional entity that is hierarchically
      intermediate between a service orchestrator and network
      controllers.  A network orchestrator can manage one or several
      network controllers.

   Network controller:  A functional entity responsible for the control
      and management of the service provider network.

   VPN node:  An abstraction that represents a set of policies applied
      on a PE and that belong to a single VPN service.  A VPN service
      involves one or more VPN nodes.  As it is an abstraction, the
      network controller will take on how to implement a VPN node.  For
      example, typically, in a BGP-based VPN, a VPN node could be mapped
      into a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF).

   VPN network access:  An abstraction that represents the network
      interfaces that are associated to a given VPN node.  Traffic
      coming from the VPN network access belongs to the VPN.  The
      attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs are terminated
      in the VPN network access.  A reference to the bearer is

      maintained to allow keeping the link between L3SM and L3NM when
      both models are used in a given deployment.

   VPN site:   A VPN customer's location that is connected to the
      service provider network via a CE-PE link, which can access at
      least one VPN [RFC4176].

   VPN service provider:  A service provider that offers VPN-related
      services [RFC4176].

   Service provider network:  A network that is able to provide VPN-
      related services.

   The document is aimed at modeling BGP PE-based VPNs in a service
   provider network, so the terms defined in [RFC4026] and [RFC4176] are
   used.

4.  L3NM Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture for the L3NM.  The figure
   is an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 5 of
   [RFC8299]; it decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that
   section into three separate functional components: Service
   Orchestration, Network Orchestration, and Domain Orchestration.

   Although some deployments may choose to construct a monolithic
   orchestration component (covering both service and network matters),
   this document advocates for a clear separation between service and
   network orchestration components for the sake of better flexibility.
   Such design adheres to the L3VPN reference architecture defined in
   Section 1.3 of [RFC4176].  This separation relies upon a dedicated
   communication interface between these components and appropriate YANG
   modules that reflect network-related information.  Such information
   is hidden to customers.

   The intelligence for translating customer-facing information into
   network-centric one (and vice versa) is implementation specific.

   The terminology from [RFC8309] is introduced to show the distinction
   between the customer service model, the service delivery model, the
   network configuration model, and the device configuration model.  In
   that context, the "Domain Orchestration" and "Config Manager" roles
   may be performed by "Controllers".

   The customer may use a variety of means to request a service that may
   trigger the instantiation of an L3NM.  The customer may use the L3SM
   or more abstract models to request a service that relies upon an
   L3VPN service.  For example, the customer may supply an IP
   Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) [RFC7297], an enhanced VPN
   (VPN+) service [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], or an IETF network slice
   service [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Note also that both the L3SM and the L3NM may be used in the context

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


5.  Relation with other YANG Models

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] includes a
   set of identities, types, and groupings that are meant to be reused
   by VPN-related YANG modules independently of the layer (e.g., Layer
   2, Layer 3) and the type of the module (e.g., network model, service
   model) including future revisions of existing models (e.g., [RFC8299]
   or [RFC8466]).  The L3NM reuses these common types and groupings.

   In order to avoid data duplication and to ease passing data between
   layers when required (service layer to network layer and vice versa),
   early versions of the L3NM reused many of the data nodes that are
   defined in [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, that approach was abandoned in
   favor of the "ietf-vpn-common" module because that initial design was
   interpreted as if the deployment of L3NM depends on L3SM, while this
   is not the case.  For example, a service provider may decide to use
   the L3NM to build its L3VPN services without exposing the L3SM.

   As discussed in Section 4, the L3NM is meant to manage L3VPN services
   within a service provider network.  The module provides a network
   view of the service.  Such a view is only visible within the service
   provider and is not exposed outside (to customers, for example).  The
   following discusses how L3NM interfaces with other YANG modules:

   L3SM:  L3NM is not a customer service model.

      The internal view of the service (i.e., L3NM) may be mapped to an
      external view which is visible to customers: L3VPN Service YANG
      data Model (L3SM) [RFC8299].

      The L3NM can be fed with inputs that are requested by customers,
      typically, relying upon an L3SM template.  Concretely, some parts
      of the L3SM module can be directly mapped into L3NM while other
      parts are generated as a function of the requested service and
      local guidelines.  Some other parts are local to the service
      provider and do not map directly to L3SM.

      Note that the use of L3NM within a service provider does not
      assume nor preclude exposing the VPN service via the L3SM.  This
      is deployment-specific.  Nevertheless, the design of L3NM tries to
      align as much as possible with the features supported by the L3SM
      to ease grafting both L3NM and L3SM for the sake of highly
      automated VPN service provisioning and delivery.

   Network Topology Modules:  An L3VPN involves nodes that are part of a
      topology managed by the service provider network.  Such topology
      can be represented using the network topology module in [RFC8345].

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


   Device Modules:  L3NM is not a device model.

      Once a global VPN service is captured by means of L3NM, the actual
      activation and provisioning of the VPN service will involve a
      variety of device modules to tweak the required functions for the
      delivery of the service.  These functions are supported by the VPN
      nodes and can be managed using device YANG modules.  A non-
      comprehensive list of such device YANG modules is provided below:

      *  Routing management [RFC8349].

      *  BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

      *  PIM [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

      *  NAT management [RFC8512].

      *  QoS management [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-qos-model].

      *  ACLs [RFC8519].

      How L3NM is used to derive device-specific actions is
      implementation-specific.

6.  Sample Uses of the L3NM Data Model

   This section provides a non-exhaustive list of examples to illustrate
   contexts where the L3NM can be used.

6.1.  Enterprise Layer 3 VPN Services

   Enterprise L3VPNs are one of the most demanded services for carriers,
   and therefore, L3NM can be useful to automate the provisioning and
   maintenance of these VPNs.  Templates and batch processes can be
   built, and as a result many parameters are needed for the creation
   from scratch of a VPN that can be abstracted to the upper Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7149][RFC7426] layer, but some manual
   intervention will still be required.

   A common function that is supported by VPNs is the addition or
   removal of customer sites.  Workflows can use the L3NM in these
   scenarios to add or prune nodes from the network data model as
   required.

6.2.  Multi-Domain Resource Management

   The implementation of L3VPN services which span across
   administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the
   administration of different management systems or controllers)
   requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
   Particularly, resources must be adequately managed in each domain to
   avoid broken configuration.

   For example, route targets (RTs) shall be synchronized between PEs.
   When all PEs are controlled by the same management system, RT
   allocation can be performed by that management system.  In cases
   where the service spans across multiple management systems, the task
   of allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains, therefore,
   the service model must provide a way to specify RTs.  In addition,
   route distinguishers (RDs) must also be synchronized to avoid
   collisions in RD allocation between separate management systems.  An
   incorrect allocation might lead to the same RD and IP prefixes being
   exported by different PEs.

6.3.  Management of Multicast Services

   Multicast services over L3VPN can be implemented using dual PIM MVPNs
   (also known as, Draft Rosen model) [RFC6037] or Multiprotocol BGP
   (MP-BGP)-based MVPNs [RFC6513][RFC6514].  Both methods are supported
   and equally effective, but the main difference is that MBGP-based
   MVPN does not require multicast configuration on the service provider
   network.  MBGP MVPNs employ the intra-autonomous system BGP control
   plane and PIM sparse mode as the data plane.  The PIM state
   information is maintained between PEs using the same architecture
   that is used for unicast VPNs.

   On the other hand, [RFC6037] has limitations such as reduced options
   for transport, control plane scalability, availability, operational
   inconsistency, and the need of maintaining state in the backbone.
   Because of these limitations, MBGP MVPN is the architectural model
   that has been taken as the base for implementing multicast service in
   L3VPNs.  In this scenario, BGP is used to auto-discover MVPN PE
   members and the customer PIM signaling is sent across the provider's
   core through MP-BGP.  The multicast traffic is transported on MPLS
   P2MP LSPs.

7.  Description of the L3NM YANG Module

   The L3NM ('ietf-l3vpn-ntw') is defined to manage L3VPNs in a service
   provider network.  In particular, the 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module can be
   used to create, modify, and retrieve L3VPN services of a network.

   The full tree diagram of the module can be generated using the
   "pyang" tool [PYANG].  That tree is not included here because it is
   too long (Section 3.3 of [RFC8340]).  Instead, subtrees are provided
   for the reader's convenience.

7.1.  Overall Structure of the Module

   The 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers: 'vpn-services'
   and 'vpn-profiles' (see Figure 3).

   The 'vpn-profiles' container is used by the provider to maintain a
   set of common VPN profiles that apply to one or several VPN services
   (Section 7.2).

   The 'vpn-services' container maintains the set of VPN services
   managed within the service provider network. 'vpn-service' is the
   data structure that abstracts a VPN service (Section 7.3).

                   Figure 3: Overall L3NM Tree Structure

7.2.  VPN Profiles

   The 'vpn-profiles' container (Figure 4) allows the VPN service
   provider to define and maintain a set of VPN profiles
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] that apply to one or several VPN
   services.

   This document does not make any assumption about the exact definition
   of these profiles.  The exact definition of the profiles is local to
   each VPN service provider.  The model only includes an identifier to
   these profiles in order to ease identifying and binding local
   policies when building a VPN service.  As shown in Figure 4, the
   following identifiers can be included:

   'external-connectivity-identifier':  This identifier refers to a
      profile that defines the external connectivity provided to a VPN
      service (or a subset of VPN sites).  An external connectivity may
      be an access to the Internet or a restricted connectivity such as
      access to a public/private cloud.

   'encryption-profile-identifier':  An encryption profile refers to a
      set of policies related to the encryption schemes and setup that
      can be applied when building and offering a VPN service.

   'qos-profile-identifier':  A Quality of Service (QoS) profile refers
      to as set of policies such as classification, marking, and actions
      (e.g., [RFC3644]).

   'bfd-profile-identifier':  A Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      profile refers to a set of BFD [RFC5880] policies that can be
      invoked when building a VPN service.

   'forwarding-profile-identifier':  A forwarding profile refers to the
      policies that apply to the forwarding of packets conveyed within a
      VPN.  Such policies may consist, for example, of applying Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).

   'routing-profile-identifier':  A routing profile refers to a set of
      routing policies that will be invoked (e.g., BGP policies) when
      delivering the VPN service.

7.3.  VPN Services

   The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that abstracts a VPN service
   in the service provider network.  Each 'vpn-service' is uniquely
   identified by an identifier: 'vpn-id'.  Such 'vpn-id' is only
   meaningful locally (e.g., the network controller).  The subtree of
   the 'vpn-services' is shown in Figure 5.

   The description of the VPN service data nodes that are depicted in
   Figure 5 are as follows:

   'vpn-id':  Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the
      L3VPN service within L3NM scope.

   'vpn-name':  Associates a name with the service in order to
      facilitate the identification of the service.

   'vpn-description':  Includes a textual description of the service.

      The internal structure of a VPN description is local to each VPN
      service provider.

   'customer-name':  Indicates the name of the customer who ordered the
      service.

   'parent-service-id':  Refers to an identifier of the parent service
      (e.g, L3SM, IETF network slice, VPN+) that triggered the creation
      of the VPN service.  This identifier is used to easily correlate
      the (network) service as built in the network with a service
      order.  A controller can use that correlation to enrich or
      populate some fields (e.g., description fields) as a function of
      local deployments.

   'vpn-type':  Indicates the VPN type.  The values are taken from
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  For the L3NM, this is typically set
      to BGP/MPLS L3VPN, but other values may be defined in the future
      to support specific Layer 3 VPN capabilities (e.g.,
      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement]).

   'vpn-service-topology':  Indicates the network topology for the
      service: hub-spoke, any-to-any, or custom.  The network
      implementation of this attribute is defined by the correct usage
      of import and export profiles (Section 4.3.5 of [RFC4364]).

   'status':  Is used to track the service status of a given VPN
      service.  Both operational and administrative status are
      maintained together with a timestamp.  For example, a service can
      be created, but not put into effect.

      Administrative and operational status can be used as a trigger to
      detect service anomalies.  For example, a service that is declared
      at the service layer as being active but still inactive at the
      network layer may be an indication that network provision actions
      are needed to align the observed service status with the expected
      service status.

   'vpn-instance-profiles':  Defines reusable parameters for the same
      'vpn-service'.

      More details are provided in Section 7.4.

   'underlay-transport':  Describes the preference for the transport
      technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.  This
      preference is especially useful in networks with multiple domains
      and Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) types.  The underlay
      transport can be expressed as an abstract transport instance
      (e.g., an identifier of a VPN+ instance, a virtual network
      identifier, or a network slice name) or as an ordered list of the
      actual protocols to be enabled in the network.

      A rich set of protocol identifiers that can be used to refer to an
      underlay transport are defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   'external-connectivity':  Indicates whether/how external connectivity
      is provided to the VPN service.  For example, a service provider
      may provide an external connectivity to a VPN customer (e.g., to a
      public cloud).  Such service may involve tweaking both filtering
      and NAT rules (e.g., bind a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
      interface with a NAT instance as discussed in Section 2.10 of
      [RFC8512]).  These added value features may be bound to all or a
      subset of network accesses.  Some of these added value features
      may be implemented in a PE or in other nodes than PEs (e.g., a P
      node or event a dedicated node that hosts the NAT function).

      Only a pointer to a local profile that defines the external
      connectivity feature is supported in this document.

   'vpn-node':  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied to a network node and that belong to a single 'vpn-
      service'.  A VPN service is typically built by adding instances of
      'vpn-node' to the 'vpn-nodes' container.

      A 'vpn-node' contains 'vpn-network-accesses', which are the
      interfaces attached to the VPN by which the customer traffic is
      received.  Therefore, the customer sites are connected to the
      'vpn-network-accesses'.

      Note that, as this is a network data model, the information about
      customers sites is not required in the model.  Such information is
      rather relevant in the L3SM.  Whether that information is included
      in the L3NM, e.g., to populate the various 'description' data node
      is implementation specific.

      More details are provided in Section 7.5.

7.4.  VPN Instance Profiles

   VPN instance profiles are meant to factorize data nodes that are used
   at many levels of the model.  Generic VPN instance profiles are
   defined at the VPN service level and then called at the VPN node and
   VPN network access levels.  Each VPN instance profile is identified
   by 'profile-id'.  This identifier is then referenced for one or
   multiple VPN nodes (Section 7.5) so that the controller can identify
   generic resources (e.g., RTs and RDs) to be configured for a given
   VRF.

   The subtree of 'vpn-instance-profile' is shown in Figure 6.

           Figure 6: Subtree Structure of VPN Instance Profiles

   The description of the listed data nodes is as follows:

   'profile-id':  Is used to uniquely identify a VPN instance profile.

   'role':  Indicates the role of the VPN instance profile in the VPN.
      Role values are defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] (e.g.,
      any-to-any-role, spoke-role, hub-role).

   'local-autonomous-system':  Indicates the Autonomous System Number
      (ASN) that is configured for the VPN node.

   'rd':  As defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], these RD
      assignment modes are supported: direct assignment, automatic
      assignment from a given pool, automatic assignment, and no
      assignment.  For illustration purposes, the following modes can be
      used in the deployment cases:

      'directly-assigned':  The VPN service provider (service
         orchestrator) assigns explicitly RDs.  This case will fit with
         a brownfield scenario where some existing services need to be
         updated by the VPN service provider.

      'full-auto':  The network controller auto-assigns RDs.  This can
         apply for the deployment of new services.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


      'no-rd':  The VPN service provider (service orchestrator)
         explicitly wants no RD to be assigned.  This case can be used
         for CE testing within the network or for troubleshooting
         proposes.

      Also, the module accommodates deployments where only the Assigned
      Number subfield of RDs (Section 4.2 of [RFC4364]) is assigned from
      a pool while the Administrator subfield is set to, e.g., the
      Router ID that is assigned to a VPN node.  The module supports
      these modes for managing the Assigned Number subfield: explicit
      assignment, auto-assignment from a pool, and full auto-assignment.

   'address-family':  Includes a set of per-address family data nodes:

      'address-family':  Identifies the address family.  It can be set
         to IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack.

      'vpn-targets':  Specifies RT import/export rules for the VPN
         service (Section 4.3 of [RFC4364]).

      'maximum-routes':  Indicates the maximum prefixes that the VPN
         node can accept for a given routing protocol.  If 'protocol' is
         set to 'any', this means that the maximum value applies to each
         active routing protocol.

   'multicast':  Enables multicast traffic in the VPN service.  Refer to
      Section 7.7.

7.5.  VPN Nodes

   The 'vpn-node' is an abstraction that represents a set of common
   policies applied on a given network node (typically, a PE) and belong
   to one L3VPN service.  The 'vpn-node' includes a parameter to
   indicate the network node on which it is applied.  In the case that
   the 'ne-id' points to a specific PE, the 'vpn-node' will likely be
   mapped into a VRF in the node.  However, the model also allows
   pointing to an abstract node.  In this case, the network controller
   will decide how to split the 'vpn-node' into VRFs.

   In reference to the subtree shown in Figure 7, the description of VPN
   node data nodes is as follows:

   'vpn-node-id':  Is an identifier that uniquely identifies a node that
      enables a VPN network access.

   'description':  Provides a textual description of the VPN node.

   'ne-id':  Includes a unique identifier of the network element where
      the VPN node is deployed.

   'local-autonomous-system':  Indicates the ASN that is configured for
      the VPN node.

   'router-id':  Indicates a 32-bit number that is used to uniquely
      identify a router within an Autonomous System.

   'active-vpn-instance-profiles':  Lists the set of active VPN instance
      profiles for this VPN node.  Concretely, one or more VPN instance
      profiles that are defined at the VPN service level can be enabled
      at the VPN node level; each of these profiles is uniquely
      identified by means of 'profile-id'.  The structure of 'active-
      vpn-instance-profiles' is the same as the one discussed in
      Section 7.4 except 'router-id'.  Indeed, Router IDs can be
      configured per address family.  This capability can be used, for
      example, to configure an IPv6 address as a Router ID when such
      capability is supported by involved routers.

      Values defined in 'active-vpn-instance-profiles' overrides the
      ones defined in the VPN service level.

   'msdp':  For redundancy purposes, Multicast Source Discovery Protocol
      (MSDP) [RFC3618] may be enabled and used to share the state about
      sources between multiple rendez-vous points (RPs).  The purpose of
      MSDP in this context is to enhance the robustness of the multicast
      service.  MSDP may be configured on non-RP routers, which is
      useful in a domain that does not support multicast sources, but
      does support multicast transit.

   'groups':  Lists the groups to which a VPN node belongs to
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  The 'group-id' is used to
      associate, e.g., redundancy or protection constraints with VPN
      nodes.

   'status':  Tracks the status of a node involved in a VPN service.
      Both operational and administrative status are maintained.  A
      mismatch between the administrative status vs. the operational
      status can be used as a trigger to detect anomalies.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


   'vpn-network-accesses':  Represents the point to which sites are
      connected.

      Note that, unlike in the L3SM, the L3NM does not need to model the
      customer site, only the points where the traffic from the site are
      received (i.e., the PE side of PE-CE connections).  Hence, the VPN
      network access contains the connectivity information between the
      provider's network and the customer premises.  The VPN profiles
      ('vpn-profiles') have a set of routing policies that can be
      applied during the service creation.

      See Section 7.6 for more details.

7.6.  VPN Network Access

   The 'vpn-network-access' includes a set of data nodes that describe
   the access information for the traffic that belongs to a particular
   L3VPN (Figure 8).

              Figure 8: VPN Network Access Subtree Structure

   In reference to the subtree depicted in Figure 8, a 'vpn-network-
   access' includes the following data nodes:

   'id':  Is an identifier of the VPN network access.

   'interface-id':  Indicates the physical or logical interface on which
      the VPN network access is bound.

   'description':  Includes a textual description of the VPN network
      access.

   'vpn-network-access-type':  Is used to select the type of network
      interface to be deployed in the devices.  The available defined
      values are:

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


      'point-to-point':  Represents a direct connection between the
         endpoints.  The controller must keep the association between a
         logical or physical interface on the device with the 'id' of
         the 'vpn-network-access'.

      'multipoint':  Represents a multipoint connection between the
         customer site and the PEs.  The controller must keep the
         association between a logical or physical interface on the
         device with the 'id' of the 'vpn-network-access'.

      'irb':  Represents a connection coming from an L2VPN service.  An
         identifier of such service ('l2vpn-id') may be included in the
         'connection' container as depicted in Figure 9.  The controller
         must keep the relationship between the logical tunnels or
         bridges on the devices with the 'id' of the' vpn-network-
         access'.

      'loopback':  Represents the creation of a logical interface on a
         device.  An example to illustrate how a loopback interface can
         be used in the L3NM is provided in Appendix A.2.

   'vpn-instance-profile':  Provides a pointer to an active VPN instance
      profile at the VPN node level.  Referencing an active VPN instance
      profile implies that all associated data nodes will be inherited
      by the VPN network access.  However, some inherited data nodes
      (e.g., multicast) can be refined at the VPN network access level.
      In such case, refined values take precedence over inherited ones.

   'status':  Indicates both operational and administrative status of a
      VPN network access.

   'connection':  Represents and groups the set of Layer 2 connectivity
      from where the traffic of the L3VPN in a particular VPN Network
      access is coming.  See Section 7.6.1.

   'ip-connection':  Contains Layer 3 connectivity information of a VPN
      network access (e.g., IP addressing).  See Section 7.6.2.

   'routing-protocols':  Includes the CE-PE routing configuration
      information.  See Section 7.6.3.

   'oam':  Specifies the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
      (OAM) mechanisms used for a VPN network access.  See
      Section 7.6.4.

   'security':  Specifies the authentication and the encryption to be
      applied for a given VPN network access.  See Section 7.6.5.

   'service':  Specifies the service parameters (e.g., QoS, multicast)
      to apply for a given VPN network access.  See Section 7.6.6.

7.6.1.  Connection

   The 'connection' container represents the layer 2 connectivity to the
   L3VPN for a particular VPN network access.  As shown in the tree
   depicted in Figure 9, the 'connection' container defines protocols
   and parameters to enable such connectivity at layer 2.

   The traffic can enter the VPN with or without encapsulation (e.g.,
   VLAN, QinQ).  The 'encapsulation' container specifies the layer 2
   encapsulation to use (if any) and allows to configure the relevant
   tags.

   The interface that is attached to the L3VPN is identified by the
   'interface-id' at the 'vpn-network-access' level.  From a network
   model perspective, it is expected that the 'interface-id' is
   sufficient to identify the interface.  However, specific layer 2 sub-
   interfaces may be required to be configured in some implementations/
   deployments.  Such a layer 2 specific interface can be included in
   'l2-termination-point'.

   If a layer 2 tunnel is needed to terminate the service in the CE-PE
   connection, the 'l2-tunnel-service' container is used to specify the
   required parameters to set such tunneling service (e.g., VPLS,
   VXLAN).  An identity, called 'l2-tunnel-type', is defined for layer 2
   tunnel selection.  The container can also identify the pseudowire
   (Section 5.2 of [RFC4447]).

   As discussed in Section 7.6, 'l2vpn-id' is used to identify the L2VPN
   service that is associated with an IRB interface.

   To accommodate implementations that require internal bridging, a
   local bridge reference can be specified in 'local-bridge-reference'.
   Such a reference may be a local bridge domain.

   A site, as per [RFC4176] represents a VPN customer's location that is
   connected to the service provider network via a CE-PE link, which can
   access at least one VPN.  The connection from the site to the service
   provider network is the bearer.  Every site is associated with a list
   of bearers.  A bearer is the layer two connections with the site.  In
   the L3NM, it is assumed that the bearer has been allocated by the
   service provider at the service orchestration stage.  The bearer is
   associated to a network element and a port.  Hence, a bearer is just
   a 'bearer-reference' to allow the association between a service
   request (e.g., L3SM) and L3NM.

7.6.2.  IP Connection

   This container is used to group Layer 3 connectivity information,
   particularly the IP addressing information, of a VPN network access.
   The allocated address represents the PE interface address
   configuration.  Note that a distinct layer 3 interface other than the
   one indicated under the 'connection' container may be needed to
   terminate the layer 3 service.  The identifier of such interface is
   included in 'l3-termination-point'.  For example, this data node can
   be used to carry the identifier of a bridge domain interface.

                Figure 10: IP Connection Subtree Structure

   For both IPv4 and IPv6, the IP connection supports three IP address
   assignment modes for customer addresses: provider DHCP, DHCP relay,
   and static addressing.  Note that for the IPv6 case, SLAAC [RFC4862]
   can be used.  For both IPv4 and IPv6, 'address-allocation-type' is
   used to indicate the IP address allocation mode to activate for a
   given VPN network access.

   When 'address-allocation-type' is set to 'provider-dhcp', DHCP
   assignments can be made locally or by an external DHCP server.  Such
   as behavior is controlled by setting 'dhcp-service-type'.

   Figure 11 shows the structure of the dynamic IPv4 address assignment
   (i.e., by means of DHCP).

   Figure 12 shows the structure of the dynamic IPv6 address assignment

   Advertisements that will be issued for SLAAC purposes, will carry the
   IPv6 prefix that is determined by 'local-address' and 'prefix-
   length'.  For example, if 'local-address' is set to '2001:db8:0:1::1'
   and 'prefix-length' is set to '64', the IPv6 prefix that will be used
   is '2001:db8:0:1::/64'.

7.6.3.  CE-PE Routing Protocols

   A VPN service provider can configure one or more routing protocols
   associated with a particular 'vpn-network-access'.  Such routing
   protocols are enabled between the PE and the CE.  Each instance is
   uniquely identified to accommodate scenarios where multiple instances
   of the same routing protocol have to be configured on the same link.

   The subtree of the 'routing-protocols' is shown in Figure 14.

   Multiple routing instances can be defined; each uniquely identified
   by an 'id'.  The type of routing instance is indicated in 'type'.
   The values of these attributes are those defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] ('routing-protocol-type' identity).

   Configuring multiple instances of the same routing protocol does not
   automatically imply that, from a device configuration perspective,
   there will be parallel instances (e.g., multiple processes) running
   on the PE-CE link.  It is up to each implementation to decide about
   the appropriate configuration as a function of underlying
   capabilities and service provider operational guidelines.  As an
   example, when multiple BGP peers need to be implemented, multiple
   instances of BGP must be configured as part of this model.  However,
   from a device configuration point of view, this could be implemented
   as:

   o  Multiple BGP processes with a single neighbor running in each
      process.

   o  A single BGP process with multiple neighbors running.

   o  A combination thereof.

   Routing configuration does not include low-level policies.  Such
   policies are handled at the device configuration level.  Local
   policies of a service provider (e.g., filtering) are implemented as
   part of the device configuration; these are not captured in the L3NM,
   but the model allows local profiles to be associated with routing
   instances ('routing-profiles').

   The L3NM supports the configuration of one or more IPv4/IPv6 static
   routes.  Since the same structure is used for both IPv4 and IPv6, it
   was considered to have one single container to group both static
   entries independently of their address family, but that design was
   abandoned to ease the mapping with the structure in [RFC8299].  As
   depicted in Figure 15, the following data nodes can be defined for a
   given IP prefix:

   'lan-tag':  Indicates a local tag (e.g., "myfavourite-lan") that is
      used to enforce local policies.

   'next-hop':  Indicates the next-hop to be used for the static route.
      It can be identified by an IP address, an interface, etc.

   'bfd-enable':  Indicates whether BFD is enabled or disabled for this
      static route entry.

   'metric':  Indicates the metric associated with the static route
      entry.

   'preference':  Indicates the preference associated with the static
      route entry.  This preference is used to selecting a preferred
      route among routes to the same destination prefix.

   'status':  Used to convey the status of a static route entry.  This
      data node is used to control the (de)activation of individual
      static route entries.

      This container does not aim to include every BGP parameter; a
      comprehensive set of parameters belongs more to the BGP device
      model.

      The following data nodes are captured in Figure 16.  It is up to
      the implementation to derive the corresponding BGP device
      configuration:

      'description':  Includes a description of the BGP session.

      'local-autonomous-system':  Indicates a local AS Number (ASN) if a
         distinct ASN is required, other than the one configured at the
         VPN node level.

      'peer-autonomous-system':  Conveys the customer's ASN.

      'address-family':  Indicates the address-family of the peer.  It
         can be set to IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack.

      'local-address':  Specifies an address or a reference to an
         interface to use when establishing the BGP transport session.

      'neighbor':  Can indicate two neighbors (each for a given address-
         family) or one neighbor (if 'address-family' attribute is set
         to dual-stack).  A list of IP address(es) of the BGP neighbors
         can be then conveyed in this data node.

      'multihop':  Indicates the number of allowed IP hops between a PE
         and its BGP peer.

      'as-override':  If set, this parameter indicates whether ASN
         override is enabled, i.e., replace the ASN of the customer
         specified in the AS_PATH BGP attribute with the ASN identified
         in the 'local-autonomous-system' attribute.

      'allow-own-as':  Is used in some topologies (e.g., hub-and-spoke)
         to allow the provider's ASN to be included in the AS_PATH BGP
         attribute received from a CE.  Loops are prevented by setting
         'allow-own-as' to a maximum number of provider's ASN
         occurrences.  This parameter is set by default to '0' (that is,
         reject any AS_PATH attribute that includes the provider's ASN).

      'prepend-global-as':  When distinct ASNs are configured in the VPN
         node and network access levels, this parameter controls whether
         the ASN provided at the VPN node level is prepended to the
         AS_PATH attribute.

      'default-route':  Controls whether default routes can be
         advertised to the peer.

      'site-of-origin':  Is meant to uniquely identify the set of routes
         learned from a site via a particular CE/PE connection and is
         used to prevent routing loops (Section 7 of [RFC4364]).  The
         Site of Origin attribute is encoded as a Route Origin Extended
         Community.

      'ipv6-site-of-origin':  Carries an IPv6 Address Specific BGP
         Extended that is used to indicate the Site of Origin for VRF
         information [RFC5701].  It is used to prevent routing loops.

      'redistribute-connected':  Controls whether the PE-CE link is
         advertised to other PEs.

      'bgp-max-prefix':  Controls the behavior when a prefix maximum is
         reached.

         'max-prefix':  Indicates the maximum number of BGP prefixes
            allowed in the BGP session.  If the limit is reached, the
            action indicated in 'action-violate' will be followed.

         'warning-threshold':  A warning notification is triggered when
            this limit is reached.

         'violate-action':  Indicates which action to execute when the
            maximum number of BGP prefixes is reached.  Examples of such
            actions are: send a warning message, discard extra paths
            from the peer, or restart the session.

      'bgp-timers':   Two timers can be captured in this container: (1)
         'hold-time' which is the time interval that will be used for
         the HoldTimer (Section 4.2 of [RFC4271]) when establishing a
         BGP session.  (2) 'keepalive' which is the time interval for
         the KeepAlive timer between a PE and a BGP peer (Section 4.4 of
         [RFC4271]).

      'authentication':  The module adheres to the recommendations in
         Section 13.2 of [RFC4364] as it allows enabling TCP-AO
         [RFC5925] and accommodates the installed base that makes use of
         MD5.  In addition, the module includes a provision for the use
         of IPsec.

      'status':  Indicates the status of the BGP routing instance.

      Figure 17:

      'address-family':  Indicates whether IPv4, IPv6, or both address
         families are to be activated.

         When only the IPv4 address-family is requested, it will be up

         OSPFv3 [RFC6565] is used.

      'area-id':  Indicates the OSPF Area ID.

      'metric':  Associates a metric with OSPF routes.

      'sham-links':  Is used to create OSPF sham links between two VPN
         network accesses sharing the same area and having a backdoor
         link (Section 4.2.7 of [RFC4577] and Section 5 of [RFC6565]).

      'max-lsa':  Sets the maximum number of LSAs that the OSPF instance
         will accept.

      'authentication':  Controls the authentication schemes to be
         enabled for the OSPF instance.  The following options are
         supported: IPsec for OSPFv3 authentication [RFC4552],
         authentication trailer for OSPFv2 [RFC5709] [RFC7474] and
         OSPFv3 [RFC7166].

      'status':  Indicates the status of the OSPF routing instance.

      'address-family':  Indicates whether IPv4, IPv6, or both address
         families are to be activated.  This parameter is used to
         determine whether RIPv2 [RFC2453] and/or RIPng are to be
         enabled [RFC2080].

      'timers':  Indicates the following timers:

         'update-interval':  Is the interval at which RIP updates are
            sent.

         'invalid-interval':  Is the interval before a RIP route is
            declared invalid.

         'holddown-interval':  Is the interval before better RIP routes
            are released.

         'flush-interval':  Is the interval before a route is removed
            from the routing table.

      'default-metric':  Sets the default RIP metric.

      'authentication':  Controls the authentication schemes to be
         enabled for the RIP instance.

      'status':  Indicates the status of the RIP routing instance.

7.6.4.  OAM

   This container (Figure 21) defines the Operations, Administration,
   and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms used for a VPN network access.  In
   the current version of the L3NM, only BFD is supported.  The current
   data nodes can be specified:

   'desired-min-tx-interval':  Is the minimum interval, in microseconds,
      that a PE would like to use when transmitting BFD Control packets
      less any jitter applied.

   'required-min-rx-interval':  Is the minimum interval, in
      microseconds, between received BFD Control packets that a PE is
      capable of supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


   'detection-multiplier':  The negotiated transmit interval, multiplied
      by this value, provides the detection time for the PE.

   'holdtime':  Is used to indicate the expected BFD holddown time.  The
      value can be set by the customer or selected from a profile.

   'authentication':  Includes the required information to enable the
      BFD authentication modes discussed in Section 6.7 of [RFC5880].
      In particular 'meticulous' controls the activation of the
      meticulous mode discussed in Sections 6.7.3 and 6.7.4 of
      [RFC5880].

   'status':  Indicates the status of BFD.

   The 'security' container specifies the authentication and the
   encryption to be applied for a given VPN network access traffic.  As
   depicted in the subtree shown in Figure 22, the L3NM can be used to
   directly control the encryption to put in place (e.g., Layer 2 or
   Layer 3 encryption) or invoke a local encryption profile.

   The following data nodes are defined:

   'inbound-bandwidth':  Indicates the inbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., download bandwidth from the service provider to
      the site).

   'outbound-bandwidth':  Indicates the outbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., upload bandwidth from the site to the service
      provider).

   'mtu':  Indicates the MTU at the service level.

   'qos':  Is used to define a set of QoS policies to apply on a given
      connection (Figure 24).  A QoS policy may be a classification or
      an action policy.  For example, a QoS action can be defined to
      rate limit inbound/outbound traffic of a given class of service.

      Layer 4:  As discussed in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], any layer
         4 protocol can be indicated in the 'protocol' data node under
         'l3' (Figure 25), but only TCP and UDP specific match criteria
         are elaborated in this version as these protocols are widely
         used in the context of VPN services.  Augmentations can be
         considered in the future to add other Layer 4 specific data
         nodes, if needed.

         TCP or UDP-related match criteria can be specified in the L3NM
         as shown in Figure 26.

    Figure 28: Multicast Subtree Structure (VPN Instance Profile Level)

   The model supports a single type of tree: Any-Source Multicast (ASM),
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), or bidirectional.

   When ASM is used, the model supports the configuration of rendez-vous
   points (RPs).  RP discovery may be 'static', 'bsr-rp', or 'auto-rp'.
   When set to 'static', RP to multicast grouping mapping MUST be
   configured as part of the 'rp-group-mappings' container.  The RP MAY
   be a provider node or a customer node.  When the RP is a customer
   node, the RP address must be configured using the 'rp-address' leaf
   otherwise no RP address is needed.

   The model supports RP redundancy through the 'rp-redundancy' leaf.
   How the redundancy is achieved is out of scope and is up to the
   implementation.

   When a particular VPN using ASM requires a more optimal traffic
   delivery, 'optimal-traffic-delivery' can be set.  When set to 'true',
   the implementation must use any mechanism to provide a more optimal
   traffic delivery for the customer.  For example, anycast is one of
   the mechanisms to enhance RPs redundancy, resilience against
   failures, and to recover from failures quickly.

   The same structure as the one depicted in Figure 30 is used when
   configuring multicast-related parameters at the VPN node level.  When
   defined at the VPN node level (Figure 29), Internet Group Management
   Protocol (IGMP) [RFC1112][RFC2236][RFC3376], Multicast Listener
   Discovery (MLD) [RFC2710][RFC3810], and Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) [RFC7761] parameters are applicable to all VPN
   network accesses of that VPN node unless corresponding nodes are
   refined at the VPN network access level.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer



Barguil, et al.         Expires January 14, 2022              [Page 115]

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model                   July 2021


   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module:

   o  'vpn-service': An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
      undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L3VPN
      service, interrupting all the traffic of a client.  In addition,
      an attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g.,
      QoS, bandwidth, routing protocols), leading to malfunctioning of
      the service and therefore to SLA violations.  In addition, an
      attacker could attempt to create an L3VPN service or adding a new
      network access.  In addition to using NACM to prevent authorized
      access, such activity can be detected by adequately monitoring and
      tracking network configuration changes.

   Some readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'customer-name' and 'ip-connection': An attacker can retrieve
      privacy-related information which can be used to track a customer.
      Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of
      the customer-provider trust relationship.

   Several data nodes defined in the L3NM rely upon [RFC8177] for
   authentication purposes.  Therefore, this module inherits the
   security considerations discussed in Section 5 of [RFC8177].

   The following summarizes the foreseen risks of using the "ietf-l3vpn-
   ntw" module can be classified into:

   o  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify VPN services.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a VPN
      service.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to read VPN service related
      information.

Appendix A.  L3VPN Examples

A.1.  4G VPN Provisioning Example

   L3VPNs are widely used to deploy 3G/4G, fixed, and enterprise
   services mainly because several traffic discrimination policies can
   be applied within the network to deliver to the mobile customers a
   service that meets the SLA requirements.

   As it is shown in the Figure 31, typically, an eNodeB (CE) is
   directly connected to the access routers of the mobile backhaul and
   their logical interfaces (one or many according to the service type)
   are configured in a VPN that transports the packets to the mobile
   core platforms.  In this example, a 'vpn-node' is created with two
   'vpn-network-accesses'.

         +-------------+                  +------------------+
         |             |                  | PE               |
         |             |                  |  198.51.100.1    |

         |             |          vlan 1  |          |       |
         |             |>--------/------->|......    |       |
         |             |          vlan 2  |     |    |       |
         |             | Direct           |  +-------------+ |
         +-------------+ Routing          |  | vpn-node-id | |
                                          |  | 44          | |
                                          |  +-------------+ |
                                          |                  |
                                          +------------------+

                    Figure 31: Mobile Backhaul Example

   To create an L3VPN service using the L3NM, the following steps can be
   followed.

   First: Create the 4G VPN service (Figure 32).

A.3.  Multicast VPN Provisioning Example

   IPTV is mainly distributed through multicast over the LANs.  In the
   following example, PIM-SM is enabled and functional between the PE
   and the CE.  The PE receives multicast traffic from a CE that is
   directly connected to the multicast source.  The signaling between PE

   and CE is achieved using BGP.  Also, RP is statically configured for
   a multicast group.

   An example is provided below to illustrate how to configure a
   multicast L3VPN service using the L3NM.

   First, the multicast service is created together with a generic VPN
   instance profile (see the excerpt of the request message body shown
   in Figure 37)

Appendix B.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the YANG
   module defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   document and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Note to the RFC Editor: As per [RFC7942] guidelines, please remove
   this Implementation Status apendix prior publication.
