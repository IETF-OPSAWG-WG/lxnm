                    A Layer 3 VPN Network YANG Model
                     draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-05

Abstract

   This document defines a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) that can be
   used for the provisioning of Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   services within a service provider's network.  The model provides a
   network-centric view of L3VPN services.

   L3NM is meant to be used by a network controller to derive the
   configuration information that will be sent to relevant network
   devices.  The model can also facilitate the communication between a
   service orchestrator and a network controller/orchestrator.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8299] defines a Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service YANG data
   Model (L3SM) that can be used for communication between customers and
   network operators.  Such model is focused on describing the customer
   view of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) services and provides an
   abstracted view of the customer's requested services.  That approach
   limits the usage of the L3SM to the role of a Customer Service Model
   (as per [RFC8309]).

   This document defined a YANG module called L3VPN Network Model
   (L3NM).  The L3NM is aimed at providing a network-centric view of
   Layer 3 (L3) VPN services.  This data model can be used to facilitate
   communication between the service orchestrator (or a network
   operator) and the network controller/orchestrator by allowing for
   more network-centric information to be included.  It enables further
   capabilities, such as resource management or to serve as a multi-
   domain orchestration interface, where logical resources (such as
   route targets or route distinguishers) must be coordinated.

   This document uses the common VPN YANG module defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   This document does not obsolete [RFC8299].  These two modules are
   used for similar objectives but with different scopes and views.

   The L3NM YANG module is initially built with a prune and extend
   approach, taking as a starting points the YANG module described in
   [RFC8299].  Nevertheless,the L3NM is not defined as an augment to

   L3SM because a specific structure is required to meet network-
   oriented L3 needs.

   Some of the information captured in the L3SM can be passed by the
   Orchestrator in the L3NM (e.g., customer) or be used to fed some of
   the L3NM attributes (e.g., actual forwarding policies).  Some of the
   information captured in L3SM may be maintained locally within the
   Orchestrator; which is in charge of maintaining the correspondence
   between a customer view and its network instantiation.  Likewise,
   some of the information captured and exposed using the L3NM can feed
   the service layer (e.g., capabilities) to drive VPN service order
   handling, and thus the L3SM.

   The L3NM does not attempt to address all deployment cases especially
   those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported through the
   coordination of different VPNs in different underlying networks.
   More complex deployment scenarios involving the coordination of
   different VPN instances and different technologies to provide an end-
   to-end VPN connectivity are addressed by complementary YANG modules,
   e.g., [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].

   L3NM focuses on BGP Provider Edge (PE) based Layer 3 VPNs as
   described in [RFC4026][RFC4110][RFC4364] and Multicast VPNs as
   described in [RFC6037][RFC6513][RFC7988].

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8299], [RFC8309], and [RFC8453] and uses
   the terminology defined in those documents.

   The meaning of the symbols in the tree diagrams is defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Layer 3 VPN Customer Service Model (L3SM):  A YANG module that
      describes the service requirements of a L3VPN that interconnects a
      set of sites from the point of view of the customer.  The customer

      service model does not provide details on the service provider
      network.  The L3VPN Customer Service model is defined in
      [RFC8299].

   Layer 3 VPN Service Network Model (L3NM):  A YANG module that
      describes a VPN service in the service provider network.  It
      contains information of the service provider network and might
      include allocated resources.  It can be used by network
      controllers to manage and control the VPN service configuration in
      the service provider network.  The YANG module can be consumed by
      a service orchestrator to request a VPN service to a Network
      Controller.

   Service orchestrator:  A functional entity that interacts with the
      customer of a L3VPN.  The service orchestrator interacts with the
      customer using the L3SM.  The service orchestrator is responsible
      of the Customer Edge (CE) - Provider Edge (PE) attachment
      circuits, the PE selection, and requesting the VPN service to the
      Network Controller.

   Network orchestrator:  A functional entity that is hierarchically
      intermediate between a service orchestrator and network
      nontrollers.  A network orchestrator can manage one or several
      network nontrollers.

   Network controller:  A functional entity responsible for the control
      and management of the service provider network.

   VPN node:  An abstraction that represents a set of policies applied
      on a PE and that belong to a single VPN service.  A VPN service
      involves one or more VPN nodes.  As it is an abstraction, the
      network controller will take on how to implement a VPN node.  For
      example, typically, in a BGP-based VPN, a VPN node could be mapped
      into a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF).

   VPN network access:  An abstraction that represents the network
      interfaces that are associated to a given VPN node.  Traffic
      coming from the VPN network access belongs to the VPN.  The
      attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs are terminated
      in the VPN network access.  A reference to the bearer is
      maintained to allow keeping the link between L3SM and L3NM.

   VPN site:   A VPN customer's location that is connected to the
      service provider network via a CE-PE link, which can access at
      least one VPN [RFC4176].

   VPN service provider:  A service provider that offers VPN-related
      services [RFC4176].

   Service provider network:  A network that is able to provide VPN-
      related services.

   The document is aimed at modeling BGP PE-based VPNs in a service
   provider network, so the terms defined in [RFC4026] and [RFC4176] are
   used.

3.  L3NM Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture for the L3NM.  The figure
   is an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 5 of
   [RFC8299]; it decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that
   section into three separate functional components: Service
   Orchestration, Network Orchestration, and Domain Orchestration.

   Although some deployments may choose to construct a monolithic
   orchestration component (covering both service and network matters),
   this document advocates for a clear separation between service and
   network orchestration components for the sake of better flexibility.
   Such design adheres to the L3VPN reference architecture defined in
   Section 1.3 of [RFC4176].  This separation relies upon a dedicated
   communication interface between these components and appropriate YANG
   module that reflect network-related information (that is hidden to
   customers).

   The intelligence for translating customer-facing information into
   network-centric one is implementation specific.

   The terminology from [RFC8309] is introduced to show the distinction
   between the customer service model, the service delivery model, the
   network configuration model, and the device configuration model.  In
   that context, the "Domain Orchestration" and "Config Manager" roles
   may be performed by "Controllers".

   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture [RFC8453].

4.  Relation with other YANG Models

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] includes a
   set of identities, types, and groupings that are meant to be reused
   by VPN-related YANG modules independently of the layer (e.g., Layer
   2, Layer 3) and the type of the module (e.g., network model, service



Barguil, et al.          Expires August 1, 2021                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                    L3NM                      January 2021


   model) including future revisions of existing models (e.g., [RFC8299]
   or [RFC8466]).  The L3NM reuses these common types and groupings.

   In order to avoid data duplication and to ease passing data between
   layers when required (service layer to network layer and vice versa),
   early versions of the L3NM reused many of the data nodes that are
   defined in [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, that approach was abandoned in
   favor of the "ietf-vpn-common" module because that initial design was
   interpreted as if the deployment of L3NM depends on L3SM, while this
   is not the case.  For example, a service provider may decide to use
   the L3NM to build its L3VPN services without exposing the L3SM.

   As discussed in Section 3, the L3NM is meant to manage L3VPN services
   within a service provider network.  The module provides a network
   view of the service.  Such view is only visible within the service
   provider and is not exposed outside (to customers, for example).  The
   following discusses how L3NM interfaces with other YANG modules:

   L3SM:  L3NM is not a customer service model.

      The internal view of the service (i.e., L3NM) may be mapped to an
      external view which is visible to customers: L3VPN Service YANG
      data Model (L3SM) [RFC8299].

      Typically, the L3NM can be fed with inputs that are requested by
      customers, typically, relying upon a L3SM template.  Concretely,
      some parts of the L3SM module can be directly mapped into L3NM
      while other parts are generated as a function of the requested
      service and local guidelines.  Some other parts are local to the
      service provider and do not map directly to L3SM.

      Note that the use of L3NM within a service provider does not
      assume nor preclude exposing the VPN service via L3SM.  This is
      deployment-specific.  Nevertheless, the design of L3NM tries to
      align as much as possible with the features supported by the L3SM
      to ease grafting both L3NM and L3SM for the sake of highly
      automated VPN service provisioning and delivery.

   Network Topology Modules:  A L3VPN involves nodes that are part of a
      topology managed by the service provider network.  Such topology
      can be represented as using the network topology module in
      [RFC8345].

   Device Modules:  L3NM is not a device model.

      Once a global VPN service is captured by means of L3NM, the actual
      activation and provisioning of the VPN service will involve a
      variety of device modules to tweak the required functions for the

      delivery of the service.  These functions are supported by the VPN
      nodes and can be managed using device YANG modules.  A non-
      comprehensive list of such device YANG modules is provided below:

      *  Routing management [RFC8349].

      *  BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

      *  PIM [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

      *  NAT management [RFC8512].

      *  QoS management [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-qos-model].

      *  ACLs [RFC8519].

      How L3NM is used to derive device-specific actions is
      implementation-specific.

5.  Sample Uses of the L3NM Data Model

   This section provides a non-exhaustive list of examples to illustrate
   contexts where the L3NM can be used.

5.1.  Enterprise Layer 3 VPN Services

   Enterprise L3VPNs are one of the most demanded services for carriers,
   and therefore, L3NM can be useful to automate the provisioning and
   maintenance of these VPNs.  Templates and batch processes can be
   built, and as a result many parameters are needed for the creation
   from scratch of a VPN that can be abstracted to the upper Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7149][RFC7426] layer and little manual
   intervention will be still required.

   Also common addition and/or removal of sites of an existing customer
   VPN can benefit of using L3NM by creation of workflows that either
   prune or add nodes as required from the network data mode.

5.2.  Multi-Domain Resource Management

   The implementation of L3VPN services which span across
   administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the
   administration of different management systems or controllers)
   requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
   Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and
   manage to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the
   usage of unavailable resources.




Barguil, et al.          Expires August 1, 2021                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    L3NM                      January 2021


   For example, route targets (RTs) shall be synchronized between PEs.
   When all PEs are controlled by the same management system, RT
   allocation can be performed by that management system.  In cases
   where the service spans across multiple management systems, the task
   of allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains, therefore,
   the service model must provide a way to specify RTs.  In addition,
   route distinguishers (RDs) must also be synchronized to avoid
   collisions in RD allocation between separate management systems.  An
   incorrect allocation might lead to the same RD and IP prefixes being
   exported by different PEs.

5.3.  Management of Multicast Services

   Multicast services over L3VPN can be implemented using dual PIM MVPNs
   (also known as, Draft Rosen model) [RFC4364] or multiprotocol BGP
   (MBGP)-based MVPNs[RFC6513][RFC6514].  Both methods are supported and
   equally effective, but the main difference is that MBGP-based MVPN
   does not require multicast configuration on the service provider
   network.  MBGP MVPNs employ the intra-autonomous system BGP control
   plane and PIM sparse mode as the data plane.  The PIM state
   information is maintained between PEs using the same architecture
   that is used for unicast VPNs.

   On the other hand, Draft Rosen has limitations such as reduced
   options for transport, control plane scalability, availability,
   operational inconsistency, and the need of maintaining state in the
   backbone.  Because of this, MBGP MVPN is the architectural model that
   has been taken as the base for implementing multicast service on
   L3VPN.  In this scenario, BGP auto discovery is used to discover MVPN
   PE members and the customer PIM signaling is sent across provider
   core through MP-BGP.  The multicast traffic is transported on MPLS
   P2MP LSPs.  All of the previous information is carried in the MCAST-
   VPN BGP NRLI.

6.  Description of the L3NM YANG Module

   The L3NM ('ietf-l3vpn-ntw') is defined to manage L3VPNs in a service
   provider network.  In particular, the 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module can be
   used to create, modify, and retrieve L3VPN Services of a network.

   The full tree diagram of the module can be generated using the
   "pyang" tool [PYANG].  That tree is not included here because it is
   too long (Section 3.3 of [RFC8340]).  Instead, subtrees are provided
   for the reader's convenience.

6.1.  Overall Structure of the Module

   The 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers: 'vpn-services'
   and 'vpn-profiles' (see Figure 3).

   The 'vpn-services' container maintains the set of VPN services
   managed within the service provider's network. 'vpn-service' is the
   data structure that abstracts a VPN service (Section 6.3).

   The 'vpn-profiles' container is used by the provider to maintain a
   set of common VPN profiles that apply to one or several VPN services
   (Section 6.2).

                   Figure 3: Overall L3NM Tree Structure

6.2.  VPN Profiles

   The 'vpn-profiles' container (Figure 4) allows the network provider
   to define and maintain a set of common VPN profiles
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] that apply to one or several VPN
   services.  The exact definition of the profiles is local to each
   network provider.

   This document does not make any assumption about the exact definition
   of these profiles.  How such profiles are defined is deployment
   specific.  The model only includes an identifier to these profiles to
   ease identifying and binding local policies when building a VPN
   service.  As shown in Figure 4, the following identifiers can be
   included:

   'external-connectivity-identifier':  This identifier refers to a
      profile that defines external connectivity provided to a VPN
      service (or a subset of VPN sites).  An external connectivity may
      be access to Internet or restricted connectivity such as access to
      a public/private cloud.

   'encryption-profile-identifier':  An encryption profile refers to a
      set of policies related to the encryption scheme(s) and setup that
      can be applied when building and offering a VPN service.

Internet-Draft                    L3NM                      January 2021


   'qos-profile-identifier':  A Quality of Service (QoS) profile refers
      to as set of policies such as classification, marking, and actions
      (e.g., [RFC3644]).

   'bfd-profile-identifier':  A Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      profile refers to a set of BFD [RFC5880] policies that can be
      invoked when building a VPN service.

   'forwarding-profile-identifier':  A forwarding profile refers to the
      policies that apply to the forwarding of packets conveyed within a
      VPN.  Such policies may consist, for example, at applying Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).

   'routing-profile-identifier':  A routing profile refers to a set of
      routing policies that will be invoked (e.g., BGP policies) when
      delivering the VPN service.

6.3.  VPN Services

   The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that abstracts a VPN service
   in the service provider network.  Each 'vpn-service' is uniquely
   identified by an identifier: 'vpn-id'.  Such 'vpn-id' is only
   meaningful locally within the network controller.

                 Figure 5: VPN Services Subtree Structure

   The 'vpn-service' data nodes listed in Figure 5 are as follows:

   'vpn-id':  Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the
      L3VPN service within L3NM scope.

   'vpn-name' and 'vpn-description':  Are used to associate a name and a
      description with the service in order to facilitate the
      identification of the service.

   'customer-name':  Indicates the name of the customer who ordered the
      service.

   'l3sm-vpn-id':  Refers to an identifier of the L3SM service.  This
      identifier allows to easily correlate the (network) service as
      built in the network with a service order.

   'vpn-type':  Indicates the VPN type (L3VPN).

   'vpn-service-topology':  Indicates the network topology for the
      service: hub-spoke, any-to-any, and custom.  The network
      implementation of this attribute is defined by the correct usage
      of import and export profiles.

   'status':  Allows the control of the operative and administrative
      status of the service as a whole.  The L3NM allows to track
      service status ('status') of a given VPN service.  Both
      operational and administrative status are maintained together with
      a timestamp.  For example, a service can be created, but not put
      into effect.

      Administrative and operational status can be used as trigger to
      detect service anomalies.  For example, a service that is declared
      at the service layer as active but still inactive at the network
      layer is an indication that network provision actions are needed
      to align the observed service with the expected service status.

   'ie-profiles':  Defines reusable import/export policies for the same
      'vpn-service'.

      More details are provided in Section 6.3.1.

   'underlay-transport':  Describes the preference for the transport
      technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.  This
      preference is especially useful in networks with multiple domains
      and Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) types.  This version of the
      YANG module supports these options: BGP, LDP, GRE, SR, SR-TE, and
      RSVP-TE as underlay transport mechanisms.  Other profiles can be
      defined in the future.

   'external-connectivity':  Indicates whether/how external connectivity
      is provided to the VPN service.  Only a pointer to a local profile
      is supported in this version.

   'vpn-node':  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied to a network node and that belong to a single 'vpn-
      service'.  A VPN service is typically built by adding instances of
      'vpn-node' to the 'vpn-nodes' container.

      A 'vpn-node' contains 'vpn-network-accesses', which are the
      interfaces attached to the VPN by which the customer traffic is
      received.  Therefore, the customer sites are connected to the
      'vpn-network-accesses'.

      Note that, as this is a network data model, the information about
      customers sites is not required in the model.  Such information is
      rather relevant in the L3SM.

      More details are provided in Section 6.3.2.

6.3.1.  Concept of Import/Export Profiles

   The import and export profiles construct contains a list with
   information related with route targets and distinguishers (RTs and
   RDs), grouped and identified by 'ie-profile-id'.  The identifier is
   then referenced in one or multiple 'vpn-nodes' (Section 6.3.2) so the
   controller can identify RTs and RDs to be configured for a given VRF.
   The subtree is shown in Figure 6.

   Note that RDs can be explicitly configured or automatically assigned.
   RD auto-assignment can also constrained by indicating an 'rd-pool-
   name'.

6.3.2.  VPN Nodes

   The 'vpn-node' is an abstraction that represents a set of common
   policies applied on a given network node (tipcally, a PE) and belong
   to one L3VPN service.  In order to indicate the network nodes where
   the 'vpn-node' applies, the 'ne-id' must be indicated.  The 'vpn-
   node' includes a parameter to indicate the network node on which it
   is applied.  In the case that the 'ne-id' points to a specific PE,
   the 'vpn-node' will likely be mapped into a VRF in the node.
   However, the model also allows to point to an abstract node.  In this
   case, the network controller will decide how to split the 'vpn-node'
   into VRFs.  Some 'vpn-node' parameters are listed below:

   'vpn-node-id':

   'vpn-node-id':

   'local-autonomous-system':  Refers to the autonomous system number
      that is locally configured in the instance.  It can be overwritten
      for specific purposes in the CE-PE BGP session.

   'maximum-routes':  Sets the maximum number of prefixes allowed in the
      'vpn-node' instance.  This value is typically set in the service
      request.

Internet-Draft                    L3NM                      January 2021


   'rd' and 'vpn-targets':  For the cases the logical resources are
      managed outside the network controller, the model allows to
      explicitely indicate the logical resources such as Route targets
      (RTs) and Route Distinguishers (RDs) (RT,RD).

   'multicast':  Enables multicast traffic inside the VPN.  Refer to
      Section 6.3.2.2.

   Under the VPN Node ('vpn-node') container, VPN Network Accesses
   ('vpn-network-access') can be created.  The VPN Network Access
   represents the point to which sites are connected.  Note that, unlike
   in L3SM, the L3NM does not need to model the customer site, only the
   points where the traffic from the site are received (i.e., the PE
   side of PE-CE connections).  Hence, the VPN Network access contains
   the connectivity information between the provider's network and the
   customer premises.  The VPN profiles ('vpn-profiles') have a set of
   routing policies than can be applied during the service creation.

   The L3NM allows to track the status ('status') of the nodes involved
   in a VPN service.  Both operational and administrative status are
   maintained.  Mismatch between an administrative status vs.  the
   operational status can be used as trigger to detect anomalies.

6.3.2.1.  RT/RD Assignment

   For the cases the logical resources are managed outside the network
   controller, the model allows to explicitely indicate the logical
   resources such as Route targets (RTs) and Route Distinguishers (RDs)
   (RT,RD).

   Three possible behaviors are needed to fulfil the identified use
   cases:





Barguil, et al.          Expires August 1, 2021                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                    L3NM                      January 2021


   o  The network controller auto-assigns logical resources (RTs, RDs).
      This can apply for new services deployment.

   o  The Network Operator/service orchestrator assigns explicitly the
      RTs and RDs.  This case will fit with a brownfield scenario where
      some existing services needs to be updated by the network
      operators.

   o  The Network Operator/service orchestrator explicitly wants NO RT/
      RD to be assigned.  This case will fit in VRF-Lite scenarios, CE
      testing inside the Network or just for troubleshooting pruposes.

   Thus a union between two yang data types are included in order to
   support this scenarios.  So, if the leaf is not created in the Yang
   the expected behavior is the auto-assigns.  If the Leaf is created
   with a valid rd value it will be explicitly assign in the VPN Node
   and if the leaf is created with an empty value, the RD value will not
   be deployed in the VPN node.

6.3.2.2.  Multicast

   Multicast may be enabled for a particular vpn-network-node (see
   Figure 8).

   The model supports a single type of tree (Any-Source Multicast (ASM),
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), or bidirectional).

   When ASM is used, the model supports the configuration of rendez-vous
   points (RPs).  RP discovery may be 'static', 'bsr-rp', or 'auto-rp'.
   When set to 'static', RP to multicast grouping mapping MUST be
   configured as part of the 'rp-group-mappings' container.  The RP MAY
   be a provider node or a customer node.  When the RP is a customer
   node, the RP address must be configured using the 'rp-address' leaf
   otherwise no RP address is needed.

   The model supports RP redundancy through the 'rp-redundancy' leaf.
   How the redundancy is achieved is out of scope and is up to the
   implementation.

   When a particular VPN using ASM requires a more optimal traffic
   delivery, 'optimal-traffic-delivery' can be set.  When set to 'true',
   the implementation must use any mechanism to provide a more optimal
   traffic delivery for the customer.  Anycast is one of the mechanisms
   to enhance RPs redundancy, resilience against failures, and to
   recover from failures quickly.

   For redundancy purposes, Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)
   [RFC3618] may be enabled and used to share the state about sources

   between multiple RPs.  The purpose of MSDP in this context is to
   enhance the robustness of the multicast service.  MSDP may be
   configured on Non-RP routers, which is useful in a domain that does
   not support multicast sources, but does support multicast transit.

6.3.2.3.  VPN Network Access

   A 'vpn-network-access' represents an entry point to a VPN service
   (Figure 9).  In other words, this container encloses the parameters
   that describe the access information for the traffic that belongs to
   a particular L3VPN.  As such, every 'vpn-network-access' MUST belong
   to one and only one 'vpn-node'.

   A 'vpn-network-access' includes information such as the connection on
   which the access is defined (see Section 6.3.2.3.1), the
   encapsulation of the traffic, policies that are applied on the
   access, etc.

   Each 'vpn-network-access' SHOULD have a 'vpn-network-access-type' to
   select the type of network interface to be deployed in the devices.
   The available options are:

   o  Point-to-Point: The point-to-point type represent a direct
      connection between the end-points.  It implies the controller must
      keep the association between a logical or physical interface on
      the device with the 'id' of the vpn-network-access.

   o  Multipoint: This option represents a broadcast connection between
      end-points.  It implies the controller must keep the association
      between a logical or physical interface on the device with the
      'id' of the 'vpn-network-access'.

   o  Pseudowire: Represent a connection coming from an L2VPN service.
      It implies the controller must keep the relationship between the
      logical tunnels or bridges on the devices with the 'id' of the'
      vpn-network-access'.

   o  Loopback: It represents the creation of a logical interface on the
      devices.

   A PNC [RFC8453] will accept VPN requests containing this construct,
   using the enclosed data to: configure the router's interface to
   include the parameters described at the 'vpn-network-access', include
   the given interface into a VRF, configuring policies or schedulers

6.3.2.3.1.  Connection

   The definition of a L3VPN is commonly specified not only at the IP
   layer, but also requires to identify parameters at the Ethernet
   layer, such as encapsulation type (e.g., VLAN, QinQ, QinAny, VxLAN,
   etc.).  The 'connection' container represents and groups the set of
   Layer 2 connectivity from where the traffic of the L3VPN in a
   particular VPN Network access is coming.

   Ethernet encapsulation description is not supported in [RFC8299].
   However, this parameters are mandatory to configure the PE
   interfaces.  Thus, in the L3NM, these parameters uses the connection
   container inside the 'vpn-network-access'.  This container defines
   protocols and parameters to enable connectivity at Layer 2.

   Additionally, the 'bearer-reference' and the pseudowire termination
   are supported (see Figure 11).  A site, as per [RFC4176] represents a
   VPN customer's location that is connected to the service provider
   network via a CE-PE link, which can access at least one VPN.  The
   connection from the site to the service provider network is the

   bearer.  Every site is associated with a list of bearers.  A bearer
   is the layer two connections with the site.  In the module it is
   assumed that the bearer has been allocated by the service provider at
   the service orchestration step.  The bearer is associated to a
   network element and a port.  Hence, a bearer is just a bearer-
   reference to allow the translation between L3SM and L3NM.

6.3.2.3.2.  IP Connections

   IP connection container (Figure 12) has the parameters of the 'vpn-
   network-access' addressing information.  The address allocated in
   this container would represent the PE interface address
   configuration.  The IP connection container is designed to support
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  It also supports three IP address assignment
   modes: SLAAC [RFC7527], Provider DHCP, DHCP relay, and static
   addressing.  Only one of them is enabled for a given service.

   protocols associated with a particular 'vpn-network-access'
   (Figure 14).  This protocol will run between the PE and the CE.  A
   routing protocol instance MUST have a type (e.g., bgp, ospf) and an
   identifier.  The identifier is necessary when multiple instances of
   the same protocol have to be configured.

   Routing configuration does not include low-level policies.  These
   policies are low level device configurations that must not be part of
   an abstracted model.  A provider's internal policies (such as
   security filters) will be implemented as part of the device
   configuration but does not require any input from this model.  Some
   policies like primary/backup or load-balancing can be inferred from
   'access-priority'.

   When configuring multiple instances of the same routing protocol,
   this does not automatically imply that, from a device configuration
   perspective, there will be parallel instances (multiple processes)
   running.  It will be up to the implementation to use the most
   appropriate deployment model.  As an example, when multiple BGP peers
   need to be implemented, multiple instances of BGP must be configured
   as part of this model.  However, from a device configuration point of
   view, this could be implemented as:

   o  Multiple BGP processes with a single neighbor running in each
      process.

   o  A single BGP process with multiple neighbors running.

   o  A combination of both.

   To be aligned with [RFC8299], this model supports the following CE-PE
   routing protocols:

   o  OSPF: The model (Figure 15) allows the user to configure OSPF to
      run as routing protocol on the 'vpn-network-access interface'.  An
      OSPF instance can be bound to IPv4, IPv6 or both.  When only IPv4
      address-family is requested, it will be up to the implementation
      to drive whether OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 is used.

   o  BGP: The model (Figure 16) allows to configure a BGP neighbor,
      including a set for parameters that are pertinent to be tweaked at
      the network level for service customization purposes.  This
      container does not aim to include every BGP parameter; a
      comprehensive set of parameters belongs more to the BGP device
      model.  The following parameters are captured in Figure 16.  It is
      up to the implementation to drive the corresponding BGP device
      configuration.

      *  'peer-autonomous-system': This parameter conveys the Customer's
         AS Number (ASN).

      *  'local-autonomous-system': This parameter is set of AS override
         is activated for this peer.

      *  'address-family': This attribute indicates the address-family
         of the peer.  It can be set to IPv4, IPv6, or both address-
         families.

      *  'neighbor': The module supports supplying two neighbors (each
         for a given address-family) or one neighbor (if 'address-
         family' attribute is set to both IPv4 and IPv6 address-
         families).  A list of IP address(es) of the BGP neighbor can be
         then conveyed in this parameter.

      *  'multihop': This attribute indicates the number of allowed IP
         hops between a BGP peer and a PE.

      *  'security': The authentication type will be driven by the
         implementation but the module supports any authentication that
         uses a key as a parameter.

      *  'as-override': If set, this parameter indicates whether AS
         override is enabled, i.e., replace the ASN of the peer
         specified in the AS Path attribute with the ASN identified by
         the 'local-autonomous-system' attribute.

      *  'default-route': This attribute controls whether default
         route(s) can be advertised to the peer.

      *  'bgp-max-prefix': This attribute is used to control how many
         prefixes can be received from a neighbor.  If reached, the BGP
         session will be teared down.

      *  'bgp-timer': Two timers can be captured in this container: (1)
         'hold-time' which is the time interval that will be used for
         the HoldTimer (Section 4.2 of [RFC4271]) when establishing a
         BGP session. (2) 'keep-alive' which is the time interval for

   The following attributes are defined:

   o  'svc-input-bandwidth': Indicates the inbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., download bandwidth from the SP to the site).

   o  'svc-output-bandwidth': Indicates the outbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., upload bandwidth from the site to the SP).

   o  'svc-mtu': Indicates the MTU at service level.  It can be the IP
      MTU or MPLS MTU, for example.

   o  'carrierscarrier': Groups a set of parameters that are used when
      CsC is enabled such the use of BGP for signalling purposes
      [RFC8277].

   o  'multicast': Specifies the multicast mode and other service-
      related attributes such as the address-family.

   o  'qos': Is used to define QoS policies to apply on a given
      connection.  Classification can be based on many criteria such as:

      *  Layer 3: As shown in Figure 22, the model allow to classify
         based on any IP header field or a combination thereof.  Both
         IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

         name: ietf-l3vpn-ntw
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-ntw

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] . The lowest NETCONF layer



Barguil, et al.          Expires August 1, 2021                [Page 89]

Internet-Draft                    L3NM                      January 2021


   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8466].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module is used to manage Layer 3 VPNs in a
   service provider backbone network.  Hence, the module can be used to
   request, modify, or retrieve L3VPN services.  For example, the
   creation of a 'vpn-service' leaf instance triggers the creation of an
   L3VPN Service in a service provider network.

   Due to the foreseen use of the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module, there are a
   number of data nodes defined in the module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module:

   o  'vpn-service': An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
      undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L3VPN
      Service, interrupting all the traffic of a client.  In addition,
      an attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g.,
      QoS, bandwidth, routing protocols), leading to malfunctioning of
      the service and therefore to SLA violations.  In addition, an
      attacker could attempt to create a L3VPN Service or adding a new
      network access.  Such activity can be detected by adequately
      monitoring and tracking network configuration changes.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'customer-name' and 'ip-connection': An attacker can retrieve
      privacy-related information which can be used to track a customer.
      Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of
      the customer-provider trust relationship.

   The following summarizes the foreseen risks of using the "ietf-l3vpn-
   ntw" module can be classified into:

   o  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify VPN services.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a VPN
      service.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to read VPN service related
      information.

Appendix A.  L3VPN Examples

A.1.  4G VPN Provisioning Example

   L3VPNs are widely used to deploy 3G/4G, fixed, and enterprise
   services mainly because several traffic discrimination policies can
   be applied within the network to deliver to the mobile customers a
   service that meets the SLA requirements.

   As it is shown in the Figure 24, typically, an eNodeB (CE) is
   directly connected to the access routers of the mobile backhaul and
   their logical interfaces (one or many according to the Service type)
   are configured in a VPN that transports the packets to the mobile
   core platforms.  In this example, a 'vpn-node' is created with two
   'vpn-network-accesses'.

   To create a L3VPN service using the L3NM model, the following sample
   steps can be followed:

   First: Create the 4G VPN Service (Figure 25).

   POST: /restconf/data/ietf-l3vpn-ntw:l3vpn-ntw/vpn-services
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

         }
       ]
     }
   }

                       Figure 25: Create VPN Service

   Second: Create a VPN Node as depicted in Figure 26.  In this type of
   service, the VPN Node is equivalent to the VRF configured in the
   physical device ('ne-id'=10.0.0.1).

   Finally, two VPN Network Accesses are created using the same physical
   port ('port-id'=1/1/1).  Each 'vpn-network-access' has a particular
   VLAN (1,2) to differentiate the traffic between: Sync and data
   (Figure 27).

A.2.  Multicast VPN Provisioning Example

   IPTV is mainly distributed through multicast over the LANs.  In the
   following example, PIM-SM is enabled and functional between the PE
   and the CE.  The PE receives multicast traffic from a CE that is
   directly connected to the multicast source.  The signaling between PE
   and CE is achieved using BGP.  Also, RP is statically configured for
   a multicast group.

                 +-----------+   +------+     +------+    +-----------+
                 | Multicast |---|  CE  |--/--|  PE  |----|  Backbone |
                 |  source   |   +------+     +------+    |   IP/MPLS |
                 +-----------+                            +-----------+


                Figure 28: Multicast L3VPN Service Example

   To configure a Multicast L3VPN service using the L3NM model the
   procedure and the JSON with the data structure is the following:

   First, the multicast service is created (see the excerpt of the
   request message body shown in Figure 29)

      Figure 29: Create Multicast VPN Service (Excerpt of the Message
                               Request Body)

   Then, the VPN nodes are created (see the excerpt of the request
   message body shown in Figure 30).  In this example, the VPN Node will
   represent VRF configured in the physical device.

Appendix B.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the Yang
   module defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Note the RFC Editor: As per [RFC6982] guidelines, please remove this
   Implementation Status apendix prior publication.
