                    A Layer 3 VPN Network YANG Model
                     draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-05

Abstract

   This document defines a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) that can be
   used for the provisioning of Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   services within a service provider network.  The model provides a
   network-centric view of L3VPN services.

   L3NM is meant to be used by a network controller to derive the
   configuration information that will be sent to relevant network
   devices.  The model can also facilitate the communication between a
   service orchestrator and a network controller/orchestrator.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8299] defines a Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service YANG data
   Model (L3SM) that can be used for communication between customers and
   network operators.  Such model is focused on describing the customer
   view of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) services and provides an
   abstracted view of the customer's requested services.  That approach
   limits the usage of the L3SM to the role of a Customer Service Model
   (as per [RFC8309]).

   This document defined a YANG module called L3VPN Network Model
   (L3NM).  The L3NM is aimed at providing a network-centric view of
   Layer 3 (L3) VPN services.  This data model can be used to facilitate
   communication between the service orchestrator (or a network
   operator) and the network controller/orchestrator by allowing for
   more network-centric information to be included.  It enables further
   capabilities, such as resource management or to serve as a multi-
   domain orchestration interface, where logical resources (such as
   route targets or route distinguishers) must be coordinated.

   This document uses the common VPN YANG module defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   This document does not obsolete [RFC8299].  These two modules are
   used for similar objectives but with different scopes and views.

   The L3NM YANG module is initially built with a prune and extend
   approach, taking as a starting points the YANG module described in



Barguil, et al.          Expires August 22, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


   [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, the L3NM is not defined as an augment to
   L3SM because a specific structure is required to meet network-
   oriented L3 needs.

   Some of the information captured in the L3SM can be passed by the
   Orchestrator in the L3NM (e.g., customer) or be used to fed some of
   the L3NM attributes (e.g., actual forwarding policies).  Some of the
   information captured in L3SM may be maintained locally within the
   Orchestrator; which is in charge of maintaining the correspondence
   between a customer view and its network instantiation.  Likewise,
   some of the information captured and exposed using the L3NM can feed
   the service layer (e.g., capabilities) to drive VPN service order
   handling, and thus the L3SM.

   Section 5.1 of [RFC8969] illustrates how the L3NM can be used within
   the network management automation architecture.

   The L3NM does not attempt to address all deployment cases especially
   those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported through the
   coordination of different VPNs in different underlying networks.
   More complex deployment scenarios involving the coordination of
   different VPN instances and different technologies to provide an end-
   to-end VPN connectivity are addressed by complementary YANG modules,
   e.g., [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].

   L3NM focuses on BGP Provider Edge (PE) based Layer 3 VPNs as
   described in [RFC4026][RFC4110][RFC4364] and Multicast VPNs as
   described in [RFC6037][RFC6513][RFC7988].

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8299], [RFC8309], and [RFC8453] and uses
   the terminology defined in those documents.

   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

   The meaning of the symbols in the tree diagrams is defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Layer 3 VPN Customer Service Model (L3SM):  A YANG module that
      describes the service requirements of a L3VPN that interconnects a
      set of sites from the point of view of the customer.  The customer
      service model does not provide details on the service provider
      network.  The L3VPN Customer Service model is defined in
      [RFC8299].

   Layer 3 VPN Service Network Model (L3NM):  A YANG module that
      describes a VPN service in the service provider network.  It
      contains information of the service provider network and might
      include allocated resources.  It can be used by network
      controllers to manage and control the VPN service configuration in
      the service provider network.  The YANG module can be consumed by
      a service orchestrator to request a VPN service to a Network
      Controller.

   Service orchestrator:  A functional entity that interacts with the
      customer of a L3VPN.  The service orchestrator interacts with the
      customer using the L3SM.  The service orchestrator is responsible
      of the Customer Edge (CE) - Provider Edge (PE) attachment
      circuits, the PE selection, and requesting the VPN service to the
      Network Controller.

   Network orchestrator:  A functional entity that is hierarchically
      intermediate between a service orchestrator and network
      nontrollers.  A network orchestrator can manage one or several
      network nontrollers.

   Network controller:  A functional entity responsible for the control
      and management of the service provider network.

   VPN node:  An abstraction that represents a set of policies applied
      on a PE and that belong to a single VPN service.  A VPN service
      involves one or more VPN nodes.  As it is an abstraction, the
      network controller will take on how to implement a VPN node.  For
      example, typically, in a BGP-based VPN, a VPN node could be mapped
      into a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF).

   VPN network access:  An abstraction that represents the network
      interfaces that are associated to a given VPN node.  Traffic
      coming from the VPN network access belongs to the VPN.  The
      attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs are terminated

      in the VPN network access.  A reference to the bearer is
      maintained to allow keeping the link between L3SM and L3NM.

   VPN site:   A VPN customer's location that is connected to the
      service provider network via a CE-PE link, which can access at
      least one VPN [RFC4176].

   VPN service provider:  A service provider that offers VPN-related
      services [RFC4176].

   Service provider network:  A network that is able to provide VPN-
      related services.

   The document is aimed at modeling BGP PE-based VPNs in a service
   provider network, so the terms defined in [RFC4026] and [RFC4176] are
   used.

4.  L3NM Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture for the L3NM.  The figure
   is an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 5 of
   [RFC8299]; it decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that
   section into three separate functional components: Service
   Orchestration, Network Orchestration, and Domain Orchestration.

   Although some deployments may choose to construct a monolithic
   orchestration component (covering both service and network matters),
   this document advocates for a clear separation between service and
   network orchestration components for the sake of better flexibility.
   Such design adheres to the L3VPN reference architecture defined in
   Section 1.3 of [RFC4176].  This separation relies upon a dedicated
   communication interface between these components and appropriate YANG
   module that reflect network-related information (that is hidden to
   customers).

   The intelligence for translating customer-facing information into
   network-centric one is implementation specific.

   The terminology from [RFC8309] is introduced to show the distinction
   between the customer service model, the service delivery model, the
   network configuration model, and the device configuration model.  In
   that context, the "Domain Orchestration" and "Config Manager" roles
   may be performed by "Controllers".

   The customer may use a variety of means to request a service that may
   trigger the instantiation of a L3NM.  The customer may use the L3SM
   or may rely upon more abstract models to request a service that
   relies upon an L3VPN service.  For example, the customer may supply
   an IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) [RFC7297], an enhanced
   VPN (VPN+) service [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], an IETF network
   slice [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], or Abstraction
   and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) [RFC8453].

   Note also that both the L3SM and the L3NM may be used in the context
   of the ACTN architecture.  Figure 2 shows the Customer Network

5.  Relation with other YANG Models

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] includes a
   set of identities, types, and groupings that are meant to be reused
   by VPN-related YANG modules independently of the layer (e.g., Layer
   2, Layer 3) and the type of the module (e.g., network model, service
   model) including future revisions of existing models (e.g., [RFC8299]
   or [RFC8466]).  The L3NM reuses these common types and groupings.

   In order to avoid data duplication and to ease passing data between
   layers when required (service layer to network layer and vice versa),
   early versions of the L3NM reused many of the data nodes that are
   defined in [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, that approach was abandoned in
   favor of the "ietf-vpn-common" module because that initial design was
   interpreted as if the deployment of L3NM depends on L3SM, while this
   is not the case.  For example, a service provider may decide to use
   the L3NM to build its L3VPN services without exposing the L3SM.

   As discussed in Section 4, the L3NM is meant to manage L3VPN services
   within a service provider network.  The module provides a network
   view of the service.  Such view is only visible within the service
   provider and is not exposed outside (to customers, for example).  The
   following discusses how L3NM interfaces with other YANG modules:

   L3SM:  L3NM is not a customer service model.

      The internal view of the service (i.e., L3NM) may be mapped to an
      external view which is visible to customers: L3VPN Service YANG
      data Model (L3SM) [RFC8299].

      Typically, the L3NM can be fed with inputs that are requested by
      customers, typically, relying upon a L3SM template.  Concretely,
      some parts of the L3SM module can be directly mapped into L3NM
      while other parts are generated as a function of the requested
      service and local guidelines.  Some other parts are local to the
      service provider and do not map directly to L3SM.

      Note that the use of L3NM within a service provider does not
      assume nor preclude exposing the VPN service via L3SM.  This is
      deployment-specific.  Nevertheless, the design of L3NM tries to
      align as much as possible with the features supported by the L3SM
      to ease grafting both L3NM and L3SM for the sake of highly
      automated VPN service provisioning and delivery.

   Network Topology Modules:  A L3VPN involves nodes that are part of a
      topology managed by the service provider network.  Such topology
      can be represented as using the network topology module in
      [RFC8345].

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


   Device Modules:  L3NM is not a device model.

      Once a global VPN service is captured by means of L3NM, the actual
      activation and provisioning of the VPN service will involve a
      variety of device modules to tweak the required functions for the
      delivery of the service.  These functions are supported by the VPN
      nodes and can be managed using device YANG modules.  A non-
      comprehensive list of such device YANG modules is provided below:

      *  Routing management [RFC8349].

      *  BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

      *  PIM [I-D.ietf-pim-yang].

      *  NAT management [RFC8512].

      *  QoS management [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-qos-model].

      *  ACLs [RFC8519].

      How L3NM is used to derive device-specific actions is
      implementation-specific.

6.  Sample Uses of the L3NM Data Model

   This section provides a non-exhaustive list of examples to illustrate
   contexts where the L3NM can be used.

6.1.  Enterprise Layer 3 VPN Services

   Enterprise L3VPNs are one of the most demanded services for carriers,
   and therefore, L3NM can be useful to automate the provisioning and
   maintenance of these VPNs.  Templates and batch processes can be
   built, and as a result many parameters are needed for the creation
   from scratch of a VPN that can be abstracted to the upper Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7149][RFC7426] layer and little manual
   intervention will be still required.

   Also common addition and/or removal of sites of an existing customer
   VPN can benefit of using L3NM by creation of workflows that either
   prune or add nodes as required from the network data mode.

6.2.  Multi-Domain Resource Management

   The implementation of L3VPN services which span across
   administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the
   administration of different management systems or controllers)



Barguil, et al.          Expires August 22, 2021               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


   requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
   Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and
   manage to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the
   usage of unavailable resources.

   For example, route targets (RTs) shall be synchronized between PEs.
   When all PEs are controlled by the same management system, RT
   allocation can be performed by that management system.  In cases
   where the service spans across multiple management systems, the task
   of allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains, therefore,
   the service model must provide a way to specify RTs.  In addition,
   route distinguishers (RDs) must also be synchronized to avoid
   collisions in RD allocation between separate management systems.  An
   incorrect allocation might lead to the same RD and IP prefixes being
   exported by different PEs.

6.3.  Management of Multicast Services

   Multicast services over L3VPN can be implemented using dual PIM MVPNs
   (also known as, Draft Rosen model) [RFC4364] or Multiprotocol BGP
   (MP-BGP)-based MVPNs[RFC6513][RFC6514].  Both methods are supported
   and equally effective, but the main difference is that MBGP-based
   MVPN does not require multicast configuration on the service provider
   network.  MBGP MVPNs employ the intra-autonomous system BGP control
   plane and PIM sparse mode as the data plane.  The PIM state
   information is maintained between PEs using the same architecture
   that is used for unicast VPNs.

   On the other hand, [RFC4364] has limitations such as reduced options
   for transport, control plane scalability, availability, operational
   inconsistency, and the need of maintaining state in the backbone.
   Because of these limitations, MBGP MVPN is the architectural model
   that has been taken as the base for implementing multicast service in
   L3VPNs.  In this scenario, BGP auto discovery is used to discover
   MVPN PE members and the customer PIM signaling is sent across the
   provider's core through MP-BGP.  The multicast traffic is transported
   on MPLS P2MP LSPs.

7.  Description of the L3NM YANG Module

   The L3NM ('ietf-l3vpn-ntw') is defined to manage L3VPNs in a service
   provider network.  In particular, the 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module can be
   used to create, modify, and retrieve L3VPN Services of a network.

   The full tree diagram of the module can be generated using the
   "pyang" tool [PYANG].  That tree is not included here because it is
   too long (Section 3.3 of [RFC8340]).  Instead, subtrees are provided
   for the reader's convenience.

7.1.  Overall Structure of the Module

   The 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers: 'vpn-services'
   and 'vpn-profiles' (see Figure 3).

   The 'vpn-profiles' container is used by the provider to maintain a
   set of common VPN profiles that apply to one or several VPN services
   (Section 7.2).

   The 'vpn-services' container maintains the set of VPN services
   managed within the service provider network. 'vpn-service' is the
   data structure that abstracts a VPN service (Section 7.3).

                   Figure 3: Overall L3NM Tree Structure

7.2.  VPN Profiles

   The 'vpn-profiles' container (Figure 4) allows the VPN service
   provider to define and maintain a set of VPN profiles
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] that apply to one or several VPN
   services.

   This document does not make any assumption about the exact definition
   of these profiles.  The exact definition of the profiles is local to
   each VPN service provider.  The model only includes an identifier to
   these profiles in order to ease identifying and binding local
   policies when building a VPN service.  As shown in Figure 4, the
   following identifiers can be included:

   'external-connectivity-identifier':  This identifier refers to a
      profile that defines the external connectivity provided to a VPN
      service (or a subset of VPN sites).  An external connectivity may
      be an access to the Internet or a restricted connectivity such as
      access to a public/private cloud.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


   'encryption-profile-identifier':  An encryption profile refers to a
      set of policies related to the encryption scheme(s) and setup that
      can be applied when building and offering a VPN service.

   'qos-profile-identifier':  A Quality of Service (QoS) profile refers
      to as set of policies such as classification, marking, and actions
      (e.g., [RFC3644]).

   'bfd-profile-identifier':  A Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      profile refers to a set of BFD [RFC5880] policies that can be
      invoked when building a VPN service.

   'forwarding-profile-identifier':  A forwarding profile refers to the
      policies that apply to the forwarding of packets conveyed within a
      VPN.  Such policies may consist, for example, at applying Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).

   'routing-profile-identifier':  A routing profile refers to a set of
      routing policies that will be invoked (e.g., BGP policies) when
      delivering the VPN service.

                 Figure 5: VPN Services Subtree Structure

   The 'vpn-service' data nodes listed in Figure 5 are as follows:

   'vpn-id':  Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the
      L3VPN service within L3NM scope.

   'vpn-name':  Associates a name with the service in order to
      facilitate the identification of the service.

   'vpn-description':  Includes a textual description of the service.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


   'customer-name':  Indicates the name of the customer who ordered the
      service.

   'parent-service-id':  Refers to an identifier of the parent service
      (e.g, L3SM, IETF network slice, VPN+) that triggered to the L3NM
      instance.  This identifier allows to easily correlate the
      (network) service as built in the network with a service order.

   'vpn-type':  Indicates the VPN type.  The values are taken from
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  For the L3NM, this is typically set
      to BGP/MPLS L3VPN.

   'vpn-service-topology':  Indicates the network topology for the
      service: hub-spoke, any-to-any, or custom.  The network
      implementation of this attribute is defined by the correct usage
      of import and export profiles (Section 4.3.5 of [RFC4364]).

   'status':  Is used to track service status of a given VPN service.
      Both operational and administrative status are maintained together
      with a timestamp.  For example, a service can be created, but not
      put into effect.

      Administrative and operational status can be used as trigger to
      detect service anomalies.  For example, a service that is declared
      at the service layer as active but still inactive at the network
      layer is an indication that network provision actions are needed
      to align the observed service with the expected service status.

   'ie-profiles':  Defines reusable import/export policies for the same
      'vpn-service'.

      More details are provided in Section 7.3.1.

   'underlay-transport':  Describes the preference for the transport
      technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.  This
      preference is especially useful in networks with multiple domains
      and Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) types.  The underlay
      transport can be expressed as an abstract transport instance
      (e.g., an identifier of a VPN+ instance, a virtual network
      identifier, or a network slice name) or as an ordered list of the
      actual protocols to be enabled in the network.  A rich set of
      protocol identifiers that can be used to refer to an underlay
      transport are defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   'external-connectivity':  Indicates whether/how external connectivity
      is provided to the VPN service.  For example, a service provider
      may provide an external connectivity to a VPN customer (e.g., to a
      public cloud).  Such service may involve tweaking both filtering

      and NAT rules (e.g., bind a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
      interface with a NAT instance as discussed in Section 2.10 of
      [RFC8512]).  These added value features may be bound to all or a
      subset of network accesses.  Some of these added value features
      may be implemented in a PE or in other nodes than PEs (e.g., a P
      node or event a dedicated node that hosts the NAT function).

      Only a pointer to a local profile that defines the external
      connectivity feature is supported in this document.

   'vpn-node':  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied to a network node and that belong to a single 'vpn-
      service'.  A VPN service is typically built by adding instances of
      'vpn-node' to the 'vpn-nodes' container.

      A 'vpn-node' contains 'vpn-network-accesses', which are the
      interfaces attached to the VPN by which the customer traffic is
      received.  Therefore, the customer sites are connected to the
      'vpn-network-accesses'.

      Note that, as this is a network data model, the information about
      customers sites is not required in the model.  Such information is
      rather relevant in the L3SM.  Whether that information is included
      in the L3NM, e.g., to populate the various 'description' data node
      is implementation specific.

      More details are provided in Section 7.3.2.

7.3.1.  Import/Export Profiles

   The import and export profiles construct contains a list with
   information related with route targets and distinguishers (RTs and
   RDs), grouped and identified by 'ie-profile-id'.  The identifier is
   then referenced in one or multiple 'vpn-nodes' (Section 7.3.2) so
   that the controller can identify RTs and RDs to be configured for a
   given VRF.  The subtree of 'ie-profiles' is shown in Figure 6.

   The following modes are supported in:

   'full-autoasigned':  The network controller auto-assigns logical
      resources (RTs, RDs).  This can apply for the deployment of new
      services.

   'rd-from-pool':  A variant of the previous one is to indicate a pool
      from where the RD values can be auto-assigned.

   'directly-assigned':  The VPN service provider (service orchestrator)
      assigns explicitly the RTs and RDs.  This case will fit with a

      brownfield scenario where some existing services need to be
      updated by the VPN service provider.

   'no-rd':  The (service orchestrator) explicitly wants no RT/RD to be
      assigned.  This case can be used for CE testing within the network
      or for troubleshooting proposes.

7.3.2.  VPN Nodes

   The 'vpn-node' is an abstraction that represents a set of common
   policies applied on a given network node (typically, a PE) and belong
   to one L3VPN service.  The 'vpn-node' includes a parameter to

   indicate the network node on which it is applied.  In the case that
   the 'ne-id' points to a specific PE, the 'vpn-node' will likely be
   mapped into a VRF in the node.  However, the model also allows to
   point to an abstract node.  In this case, the network controller will
   decide how to split the 'vpn-node' into VRFs.

                   Figure 7: VPN Node Subtree Structure

   In reference to the subtree shown in Figure 7, the description of
   'vpn-node' parameters is as follows:

   'vpn-node-id':  Is an identifier that uniquely identifies a node.

   'description':  Providers a textual description of the VPN node.

   'ne-id':  Includes a unique identifier of the network element where
      the VPN node is deployed.

   'node-role':  Indicates the role of the VPN node in the VPN.  Roles
      values are defines defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] (e.g.,
      any-to-any-role, spoke-role, hub-role).

   'local-autonomous-system':  Indicates the BGP autonomous system
      number that is locally configured for the VPN node.

   'address-family':  Is used to identify the address family used for
      the Router ID.  It can be set to IPv4 or IPv6.

   'router-id':  Indicates a unique Router ID information.  It can be an
      IPv4 or IPv6 address as function of the 'address-family'.

   'rd':  If the logical resources are managed outside the network
      controller, the model allows to explicitly indicate the logical
      resources such as RTs and RDs.  As defined in

      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] and recalled in Section 7.3.1, RDs
      can be explicitly configured or automatically assigned.  RD auto-
      assignment can also constrained by indicating an RD pool name
      ('rd- pool-name').

   'vpn-targets':  Specifies RT import-export rules for the VPN.

   'node-ie-profile':  Refer to Section 7.3.1.

   'maximum-routes':  Indicates the maximum prefixes that the VPN node
      can accept for a given address family and routing protocol.  If
      'protocol' is set to 'any', this means that the maximum value
      applies to any active routing protocol.

   'groups':  Lists the groups to which a VPN node belongs to
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  The 'group-id' is used to
      associate, e.g., redundancy or protection constraints with VPN
      nodes.

   'multicast':  Enables multicast traffic inside the VPN.  Refer to
      Section 7.3.2.1.

   'status':  Tracks the status of the nodes involved in a VPN service.
      Both operational and administrative status are maintained.  A
      mismatch between an administrative status vs. the operational
      status can be used as a trigger to detect anomalies.

   'vpn-network-accesses':  Represents the point to which sites are
      connected.  Note that, unlike in L3SM, the L3NM does not need to
      model the customer site, only the points where the traffic from
      the site are received (i.e., the PE side of PE-CE connections).
      Hence, the VPN network access contains the connectivity
      information between the provider's network and the customer
      premises.  The VPN profiles ('vpn-profiles') have a set of routing
      policies than can be applied during the service creation.

      See Section 7.3.2.2 for more details.

7.3.2.1.  Multicast

   Multicast may be enabled for a particular vpn-network-node (see
   Figure 8).

   The model supports a single type of tree (Any-Source Multicast (ASM),
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), or bidirectional).

   When ASM is used, the model supports the configuration of rendez-vous
   points (RPs).  RP discovery may be 'static', 'bsr-rp', or 'auto-rp'.



Barguil, et al.          Expires August 22, 2021               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


   When set to 'static', RP to multicast grouping mapping MUST be
   configured as part of the 'rp-group-mappings' container.  The RP MAY
   be a provider node or a customer node.  When the RP is a customer
   node, the RP address must be configured using the 'rp-address' leaf
   otherwise no RP address is needed.

   The model supports RP redundancy through the 'rp-redundancy' leaf.
   How the redundancy is achieved is out of scope and is up to the
   implementation.

   When a particular VPN using ASM requires a more optimal traffic
   delivery, 'optimal-traffic-delivery' can be set.  When set to 'true',
   the implementation must use any mechanism to provide a more optimal
   traffic delivery for the customer.  Anycast is one of the mechanisms
   to enhance RPs redundancy, resilience against failures, and to
   recover from failures quickly.

   For redundancy purposes, Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)
   [RFC3618] may be enabled and used to share the state about sources
   between multiple RPs.  The purpose of MSDP in this context is to
   enhance the robustness of the multicast service.  MSDP may be
   configured on Non-RP routers, which is useful in a domain that does
   not support multicast sources, but does support multicast transit.

   In reference to the subtree depicted in Figure 9, a 'vpn-network-
   access' includes the following data nodes:

   'id':  Is an identifier of the VPN network access.

   'port-id':  Indicates the physical port on which the VPN network
      access is bound.

   'description':  Includes a textual description of the VPN network
      access.

   'vpn-network-access-type':  Is used to select the type of network
      interface to be deployed in the devices.  The available options
      are:

         points.  It implies that the controller must keep the
         association between a logical or physical interface on the
         device with the 'id' of the 'vpn-network-access'.

      Multipoint:  Represents a broadcast connection between the end-
         points.  It implies that the controller must keep the
         association between a logical or physical interface on the
         device with the 'id' of the 'vpn-network-access'.

         It implies that the controller must keep the relationship
         between the logical tunnels or bridges on the devices with the
         'id' of the' vpn-network-access'.

      Loopback:  Represents the creation of a logical interface on a
         device.

   'status':  Indicates both operational and administrative status of a
      VPN network access.

   'connection':  Represents and groups the set of Layer 2 connectivity
      from where the traffic of the L3VPN in a particular VPN Network
      access is coming.  See Section 7.3.2.2.1.

   'ip-connection':  Contains the IP addressing information of a VPN
      network access.  See Section 7.3.2.2.2.

   'routing-protocols':  Represents and groups the set of Layer 2
      connectivity from where the traffic of the L3VPN in a particular
      VPN Network access is coming.  See Section 7.3.2.2.3.

   'security':  Specifies the authentication and the encryption to be
      applied for a given VPN network access.  See Section 7.3.2.2.5.

   'service':  Specifies the service parameters (e.g., QoS, multicast)
      to apply for a given VPN network access.  See Section 7.3.2.2.6.

7.3.2.2.1.  Connection

   The definition of a L3VPN is commonly specified not only at the IP
   layer, but also requires to provide parameters at the Ethernet layer,
   such as specifying an encapsulation type (e.g., VLAN, QinQ, QinAny,
   VxLAN, etc.).  The L3NM uses the 'connection' container to specify
   such parameters.

   A site, as per [RFC4176] represents a VPN customer's location that is
   connected to the service provider network via a CE-PE link, which can

   access at least one VPN.  The connection from the site to the service
   provider network is the bearer.  Every site is associated with a list
   of bearers.  A bearer is the layer two connections with the site.  In
   the L3NM, it is assumed that the bearer has been allocated by the
   service provider at the service orchestration stage.  The bearer is
   associated to a network element and a port.  Hence, a bearer is just
   a bearer-reference to allow the translation between a service request
   (e.g., L3SM) and L3NM.

   As shown in Figure 10, the 'connection' container defines protocols
   and parameters to enable connectivity at Layer 2.

   A VPN service provider can configure one or more routing protocols
   associated with a particular 'vpn-network-access'.  Such routing
   protocol is enabled between the PE and the CE.  Each instance is
   uniquely identified to accommodate scenarios where multiple instances
   of the same routing protocol have to be configured on the same link.

   The subtree of the 'routing-protocols' is shown in Figure 15.

   Multiple routing instances can be defined; each uniquely identified
   by an 'id'.  The type of a routing instance is indicated in 'type'.
   The values of this attributes are those defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] ('routing-protocol-type' identity).

   Configuring multiple instances of the same routing protocol does not
   automatically imply that, from a device configuration perspective,
   there will be parallel instances (e.g., multiple processes) running
   on the PE-CE link.  It is up to each implementation to decide about
   the appropriate configuration as a function of underlying
   capabilities and service provider operational guidelines.  As an
   example, when multiple BGP peers need to be implemented, multiple
   instances of BGP must be configured as part of this model.  However,
   from a device configuration point of view, this could be implemented
   as:

   o  Multiple BGP processes with a single neighbor running in each

   o  A combination thereof.

   Routing configuration does not include low-level policies.  Such
   policies are handed at the device configuration level.  Local
   policies of a service provider (e.g., filtering) will be implemented
   as part of the device configuration; these are not captured in the
   L3NM, but the model allows to associate local profiles with routing
   instances ('routing-profiles').

   The L3NM supports the configuration of one or more IPv4/IPv6 static
   routes.  Since the same structure is used for both IPv4 and IPv6, it
   was considered to have one single container to group both static
   entries independently of their address family, but that design was
   abandoned to ease the mapping with the structure in [RFC8299].  As
   depicted in Figure 16, the following data nodes can be defined for a
   given IP prefix:

   'lan-tag':  Indicates a local tag (e.g., "myfavourite-lan") that is
      used to enforce local policies.

   'next-hop':  Indicates the next-hop to be used for the static route.
      It can be identified by an IP address, an interface, etc.

   'bfd-enable':  Indicates whether BFD is enabled or disabled for this
      static route entry.

   'metric':  Indicates the metric associated with the static route
      entry.

   'preference':  Indicates the preference associated with the static
      route entry.  This preference is used to selecting a preferred
      route among routes to the same destination prefix.

   'status':  Used to convey the status of a static route entry.  This
      data node is used to control the (de)activation of individual
      static route entries.

   In addition, the L3NM supports the following CE-PE routing protocols:

   BGP:  The L3NM allows to configure a BGP neighbor, including a set
      for parameters that are pertinent to be tweaked at the network
      level for service customization purposes.

      This container does not aim to include every BGP parameter; a
      comprehensive set of parameters belongs more to the BGP device
      model.

      The following data nodes are captured in Figure 17.  It is up to
      the implementation to derive the corresponding BGP device
      configuration:

      'description':  Includes a description of the BGP session.

      'local-autonomous-system':  Is set to the AS Number (ASN) to
         override a peers' ASN if such feature is requested by the
         customer.

      'peer-autonomous-system':  Conveys the customer's ASN.

      'address-family':  Indicates the address-family of the peer.  It
         can be set to IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack.

      'neighbor':  Can indicate two neighbors (each for a given address-
         family) or one neighbor (if 'address-family' attribute is set
         to dual-stack).  A list of IP address(es) of the BGP neighbors
         can be then conveyed in this data node.

      'multihop':  Indicates the number of allowed IP hops between a PE
         and its BGP peer.

      'as-override':  If set, this parameter indicates whether ASN
         override is enabled, i.e., replace the ASN of the peer
         specified in the AS_PATH BGP attribute with the ASN identified
         in the 'local-autonomous-system' attribute.

      'default-route':  Controls whether default route(s) can be
         advertised to the peer.

      'site-of-origin':  Is meant to uniquely identify the set of routes
         learned from a site via a particular CE/PE connection and is
         used to prevent routing loops (Section 7 of [RFC4364]).  The
         Site of Origin attribute is encoded as a Route Origin Extended
         Community.

      'ipv6-site-of-origin':  Carries an IPv6 Address Specific BGP
         Extended that is used to indicate the Site of Origin for VRF
         information [RFC5701].  It is used to prevent routing loops.

      'bgp-max-prefix':  Controls the behavior when a prefix maximum is
         reached.

Internet-Draft               L3NM YANG Model               February 2021


         'max-prefix':  Indicates the maximum number of BGP prefixes
            allowed in the BGP session.  If such limit is reached, the
            action indicated in 'action-violate' will be followed.

         'warning-threshold':a warning
         notification will be triggered'
      A warning notification is triggered when this limit is reached.

   'violate-action':  Indicates which action to execute when the maximum
      number of BGP prefixes is reached.  Examples of such actions are:
      send a warning message, discard extra paths from the peer, or
      restart the session.

      'bgp-timers':   Two timers can be captured in this container: (1)
         'hold-time' which is the time interval that will be used for
         the HoldTimer (Section 4.2 of [RFC4271]) when establishing a
         BGP session. (2) 'keep-alive' which is the time interval for
         the KeepAlive timer between a PE and a BGP peer (Section 4.4 of
         [RFC4271]).

      'security':  The module adheres to the recommendations in
         Section 13.2 of [RFC4364] as it allows to enable TCP-AO
         [RFC5925] and accommodates the installed base that make use of
         MD5.  In addition, the module includes a provision for the use
         of IPsec.

      'status':  Indicates the status of the BGP routing instance.

         OSPFv3 [RFC5340] is used.

      'area-id':  Indicates the OSPF Area ID.

      'metric':  Associates a metric with OSPF routes.

      'sham-links':  Is used to create OSPF sham links between two VPN
         network accesses sharing the same area and having a backdoor
         link (Section 4.2.7 of [RFC4577]).

      'max-lsa':  Sets the maximum number of LSAs that the OSPF instance
         will accept.

      'security':  Controls the authentication schemes to be enabled for
         the OSPF instance.  The following options are supported: IPsec
         for OSPFv3 authentication [RFC4552], authentication trailer for
         OSPFv2 [RFC5709] [RFC7474] and OSPFv3 [RFC7166].

      'status':  Indicates the status of the OSPF routing instance.

   This container (Figure 22) defines the Operations, Administration,
   and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms used for a VPN network access.  In
   the current version of the L3NM, only BFD is supported.  The current
   data nodes can be specified:

   holdtime':  Is used to indicate the expected BFD holddown time.  The
      value can be set by the customer or selected from a profile.

   'security':  Includes the required information to enable the BFD
      authentication modes discussed in Section 6.7 of [RFC5880].  In
      particular 'meticulous' controls the activation of the meticulous
      mode discussed in Sections 6.7.3 and 6.7.4 of [RFC5880].

   'status':  Indicates the status of BFD.

   The 'security' container specifies the authentication and the
   encryption to be applied for a given VPN network access traffic.  As
   depicted in the subtree shown in Figure 23, the L3NM can be used to
   directly control the encryption to put in place (e.g., Layer 2 or
   Layer 3 encryption) or invoke a local encryption profile.

   The following attributes are defined:

   'input-bandwidth':  Indicates the inbound bandwidth of the connection
      (i.e., download bandwidth from the SP to the site).

   'output-bandwidth':  Indicates the outbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., upload bandwidth from the site to the SP).

   'mtu':  Indicates the MTU at service level.  It can be the IP MTU or
      MPLS MTU, for example.

   'qos':  Is used to define a set of QoS policies to apply on a given
      connection (Figure 25).

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-ntw
         Registrant Contact: The IESG.
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

         name: ietf-l3vpn-ntw
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-ntw
         maintained by IANA: N
         prefix: l3nm
         reference: RFC XXXX

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] . The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8466].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module is used to manage Layer 3 VPNs in a
   service provider backbone network.  Hence, the module can be used to
   request, modify, or retrieve L3VPN services.  For example, the
   creation of a 'vpn-service' leaf instance triggers the creation of an
   L3VPN Service in a service provider network.

   Due to the foreseen use of the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module, there are a
   number of data nodes defined in the module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the



Barguil, et al.          Expires August 22, 2021               [Page 99]

   default).  These data nodes MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module:

   o  'vpn-service': An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
      undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L3VPN
      Service, interrupting all the traffic of a client.  In addition,
      an attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g.,
      QoS, bandwidth, routing protocols), leading to malfunctioning of
      the service and therefore to SLA violations.  In addition, an
      attacker could attempt to create a L3VPN Service or adding a new
      network access.  Such activity can be detected by adequately
      monitoring and tracking network configuration changes.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the "ietf-l3vpn-ntw" module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'customer-name' and 'ip-connection': An attacker can retrieve
      privacy-related information which can be used to track a customer.
      Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of
      the customer-provider trust relationship.

   The following summarizes the foreseen risks of using the "ietf-l3vpn-
   ntw" module can be classified into:

   o  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify VPN services.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a VPN
      service.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to read VPN service related
      information.

Appendix A.  L3VPN Examples

A.1.  4G VPN Provisioning Example

   L3VPNs are widely used to deploy 3G/4G, fixed, and enterprise
   services mainly because several traffic discrimination policies can
   be applied within the network to deliver to the mobile customers a
   service that meets the SLA requirements.

   As it is shown in the Figure 28, typically, an eNodeB (CE) is
   directly connected to the access routers of the mobile backhaul and
   their logical interfaces (one or many according to the Service type)
   are configured in a VPN that transports the packets to the mobile
   core platforms.  In this example, a 'vpn-node' is created with two
   'vpn-network-accesses'.

   To create a L3VPN service using the L3NM, the following sample steps
   can be followed:

   First: Create the 4G VPN service (Figure 29).

        POST: /restconf/data/ietf-l3vpn-ntw:l3vpn-ntw/vpn-services
        Host: example.com
        Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

        {
          "ietf-l3vpn-ntw:vpn-services": {
            "vpn-service": [
              {
                "vpn-id": "4G",
                "customer-name": "mycustomer",
                "vpn-service-topology": "custom",
                "description": "VPN to deploy 4G services"
              }
            ]
          }
        }

                       Figure 29: Create VPN Service

   Second: Create a VPN node as depicted in Figure 30.  In this type of
   service, the VPN node is equivalent to the VRF configured in the
   physical device ('ne-id'=198.51.100.1).

   Finally, two VPN network accesses are created using the same physical
   port ('port-id'=1/1/1).  Each 'vpn-network-access' has a particular
   VLAN (1,2) to differentiate the traffic between: Sync and data
   (Figure 31).

A.2.  Multicast VPN Provisioning Example

   IPTV is mainly distributed through multicast over the LANs.  In the
   following example, PIM-SM is enabled and functional between the PE
   and the CE.  The PE receives multicast traffic from a CE that is
   directly connected to the multicast source.  The signaling between PE
   and CE is achieved using BGP.  Also, RP is statically configured for
   a multicast group.

   To configure a Multicast L3VPN service using the L3NM model the
   procedure and the JSON with the data structure is the following:

   First, the multicast service is created (see the excerpt of the
   request message body shown in Figure 34)

          {
            "ietf-l3vpn-ntw:vpn-services": {
              "vpn-service": [

                               Request Body)

   Then, the VPN nodes are created (see the excerpt of the request
   message body shown in Figure 35).  In this example, the VPN Node will
   represent VRF configured in the physical device.

Appendix B.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the Yang
   module defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Note the RFC Editor: As per [RFC6982] guidelines, please remove this
   Implementation Status apendix prior publication.
