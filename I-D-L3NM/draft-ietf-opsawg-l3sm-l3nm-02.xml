    <abstract>
      <t>RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be
      used for communication between customers and VPN service providers. That
      data model plays the role of a Customer Service Model, according to the
      terminology defined in RFC8309, and is as such adequate for service
      negotiation and order handling matters.</t>

      <t>There is a need for a more network-centric YANG data model to be used
      in the communication between the entity that interacts directly with the
      customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully automated or a human
      operator) and the entity in charge of network orchestration and control
      (a.k.a., network controller/orchestrator). Such model is meant to
      capture a (internal) network-oriented VPN Service that will be used for
      the actual provisioning and delivery of the service.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) to
      facilitate communication between a service orchestrator and a network
      controller/orchestrator. Such data model provides a network-centric view
      of the L3VPN services. This L3NM module is limited to BGP PE-based VPNs
      as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC8299"/> defines an L3VPN Service YANG data Model
      (L3SM) that can be used for communication between customers and network
      operators. Such model is focused on describing the customer view of the
      VPN services, and provides an abstracted view of the customer's
      requested services. That aproach limits the usage of the L3SM module to
      the role of a Customer Service Model, according to the terminology
      defined in <xref target="RFC8309"/>.</t>

      <t>The YANG data model defined in this document is called L3VPN Network
      Model (L3NM). The L3NM module is aimed at providing a network-centric
      view of L3 VPN Services. The data model can be used to facilitate
      communication between the service orchestrator (or a network operator)
      and the network controller/orchestrator by allowing for more
      network-centric information to be included. It enables further
      capabilities, such as resource management or to serve as a multi-domain
      orchestration interface, where logical resources (such as route targets
      or route distinguishers) must be synchronized.</t>

      <t>This document does not obsolete, but uses, the definitions in <xref
      target="RFC8299"/>. These two modules are used for similar objectives
      but with differents scopes and views.</t>

      <t>The L3NM YANG module is initially built with a prune and extend
      approach, taking as a starting points the YANG module described in <xref
      target="RFC8299"/>. Nevertheless, this module is not defined as an
      augment to L3SM because a specific structure is required to meet
      network-oriented L3 needs.</t>

      <t>Some of the information captured in the L3SM can be passed by the
      Orchestrator in the L3NM (e.g., customer) or be used to fed some of the
      L3NM attribute (e.g., actual forwarding policies). Some of the
      information captured in L3SM may be maintained locally within the
      Orchestrator; which is supposed to maintain a "glue" between a Customer
      view and its network instantiation. Likewise, some of the information
      captured and exposed using L3NM can fed the service layer (e.g.,
      capabilities) to derive L3SM and drive VPN service order handling.</t>

      <t>The L3NM module does not attempt to address all deployment cases
      especially those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported through the
      coordination of different VPNs in different underlying networks. More
      complex deployment scenarios involving the coordination of different VPN
      instances and different technologies to provide end-to-end VPN
      connectivity are addressed by a complementary YANG model defined in
      <xref target="I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
      of <xref target="RFC6241"/>, <xref target="RFC7950"/>, <xref
      target="RFC8299"/>, <xref target="RFC8309"/>, and <xref

      documents.</t>

      <t>The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in in <xref
      target="RFC8340"/>.</t>

      <t>The document is aimed at modeling BGP PE-based VPNs in a Service
      Provider Network, so the terms defined in <xref target="RFC4026"/> and
      <xref target="RFC4176"/> are used.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the following terms:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>L3 VPN Customer Service Model (L3SM): Describes the requirements
          of a L3 VPN that interconnects a set of sites from the point of view
          of the customer. The customer service model does not provide details
          on the Service Provider Network. The L3 VPN Customer Service model
          is defined in <xref target="RFC8299"/>.</t>

          <t>L3 VPN Service Network Model (L3NM): A YANG module that describes
          a VPN Service in the Service Provider Network. It containts
          information of the Service Provider network and might include
          allocated resources. It can be used by network controllers to manage
          and control the VPN Service configuration in the Service Provider
          network. The YANG module can be consumed by a Service Orchestrator
          to request a VPN Service to a Network controller.</t>

          <t>Service Orchestrator: A functional entity that interacts with the
          customer of a L3 VPN. The Service Orchestrator interacts with the
          customer using L3SM. The Service Orchestrator is responsible of the
          CE-PE attachment circuits, the PE selection, and requesting the VPN
          service to the network controller.</t>

          <t>Network Controller: A functional entity responsible for the
          control and management of the service provider network.</t>

          <t>VPN node (vpn-node): An abstraction that represents a set of
          policies applied to a PE and that belong to a single VPN service
          (vpn-service). A vpn-service involves one or more vpn-nodes. As it
          is an abstraction, the network controller will take on how to
          implement a vpn-node. For example, typically, in a BGP-based VPN, a
          vpn-node could be mapped into a VRF.</t>

          <t>VPN network access (vpn-network-access): An abstraction that
          represents the network interfaces that are associated to a given
          vpn-node. Traffic coming from the vpn-network-access belongs to the
          VPN. The attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs are
          terminated in the vpn-network-access. A reference to the bearer is
          maintained to allow keeping the link between L3SM and L3NM.</t>

          <t>VPN Site (vpn-site): A VPN customer's location that is connected
          to the Service Provider network via a CE-PE link, which can access
          at least one VPN <xref target="RFC4176"/>.</t>

          <t>VPN Service Provider (SP): A Service Provider offers VPN-related
          services <xref target="RFC4176"/>.</t>

          <t>Service Provider (SP) Network: A network able to provide
          VPN-related services.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reference Architecture">
      <t>Figure 1 depices the reference architecture for L3NM. The figure is
      an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC8299"/> and decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that
      figure into three separate functional components called "Service
      Orchestration", "Network Orchestration", and "Domain Orchestration".</t>

      <t>Although some deployments may choose to construct a monolithic
      orchestration component (covering both service and network matters),
      this document advocates for a clear separation between service and
      network orchestration components for the sake of better flexibility.
      Such design adheres to the L3VPN reference architecture defined in
      Section 1.3 of <xref target="RFC4176"/>. The above separation relies
      upon a dediciated communication interface between these components and
      appropriate YANG module that reflect network-related information (that
      is hidden to customers).</t>

      <t>The intelligence for translating customer-facing information into
      network-centric one is implementation-specific.</t>

      <t>The terminology from <xref target="RFC8309"/> is introduced to show
      the distinction between the "Customer Service Model", the "Service
      Delivery Model", the "Network Configuration Model", and the "Device
      Configuration Model". In that context, the "Domain Orchestration" and
      "Config Manager" roles may be performed by "Controllers".</t>

      <t>As discussed in the previous section, the L3NM YANG module is meant

          template. Concretely, some parts of the L3SM module can be directly
          mapped into L3NM while other parts are generated as a function of
          the requested service and local guidelines. Some other parts are
          local to the Service Provider and do not map directly to
          L3SM.<vspace blankLines="1"/>Note that the use of L3NM within a
          Service Provider does assume nor preclude exposing the VPN service
          via L3SM. This is deployment-specific. Nevertheless, the design of
          L3NM tries to align as much as possible with the features supported
          by the L3SM to ease grafting both L3NM and L3SM for the sake of

      <t>The L3NM module ('ietf-l3vpn-ntw') is meant to manage L3 VPNs in a
      service provider network. In particular, the 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module can
      be used to create, modify, and retrieve L3VPN Services of a network.</t>

      <section anchor="structure_model" title="Structure of the Module">
        <t>The 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers:
        'vpn-services' and 'vpn-profiles' (see <xref
        target="ietf-l3vpn-ntw_tree"/>). The 'vpn-services' container
        maintains the set of VPN Services managed in the service provider
        network. The module allows to create a new VPN service by adding a new
        instance of 'vpn-service'. The 'vpn-service' is the data structure
        that abstracts the VPN Service.</t>

        <t>The 'vpn-profiles' container allows the provider to maintain a set
        of commmon VPN profiles that apply to several VPN Services.</t>

        <t>A VPN Service is built by adding instances of 'vpn-node' to the
        'vpn-nodes' container. The 'vpn-node' is an abstraction that
        represents a set of policies applied to a network node and that belong
        to a single 'vpn-service'. A 'vpn-node' contains
        'vpn-network-accesses', which are the interfaces involved in the
        creation of the VPN. The customer sites are connected to the
        'vpn-network-accesses'. Note that, as this is a network data model,
        the information about customers sites is not needed. Such information,
        is rather relevant in the L3SM model.</t>

          the 'vpn-node' applies the 'ne-id' must be indicated. The 'vpn-node'
          includes a parameter to indicate in which network node it is

          in L3SM, the L3NM does not need to model the customer site, only the
          points where the traffic from the site are received. Hence, the VPN
          Network access contains the connectivity information between the
          provider's network and the customer premises. The VPN profiles
          ('vpn-profiles') have a set of routing policies than can be applied

                <t>A site, as per <xref target="RFC4176"/> represents a VPN
                customer's location that is connected to the Service Provider
                network via a CE-PE link, which can access at least one VPN.
                The connection from the site to the Service Provider network
                is the bearer. Every site is associated with a list of
                bearers. A bearer is the layer two connections with the site.
                In the module it is assumed that the bearer has been allocated
                by the Service Provider at the service orchestration step. The
                bearer is associated to a network element and a port. Hence, a
                bearer is just a bearer-reference to allow the translation
                between L3SM and L3NM.</t>

              <t>IP Connection container has the parameters of the
              vpn-network-access addressing information. The address allocated
              in this container would represent the PE interface address
              configuration. The IP Connection container is designed to
              support dual stack (IPv4/IPv6) and three options to set the ip
              address: Provider DHCP, DHCP relay or static addressing.</t>

              <t>In the case of the static addressing the model supports the

              primary address of the connection the "primary-address"

            <section anchor="ro_pro" title="Routing Protocols">
              <t>The model allows the Network Operator to configure one or
              more routing protocols associated with a particular
              vpn-network-access. This protocol will run between the PE and
              the CE. A routing protocol instance MUST have a type (e.g. bgp,
              ospf, etc.) and an identifier. The identifier is necessary when
              multiple instances of the same protocol need to be
              configured.</t>

              <t>The model uses an abstracted view of routing protocols. When
              configuring multiple instances of the same protocol, this does
              not automatically imply that, from a device configuration
              perspective, there will be parallel instances (multiple
              processes) running. It will be up to the implementation to use
              the most appropriate deployment model. As an example, when
              multiple BGP peers need to be implemented, multiple instances of
              BGP must be configured as part of this model. However from a
              device configuration point of view, this could be implemented
              as: <list style="symbols">
                  <t>Multiple BGP processes with a single neighbor running in
                  each process.</t>

                  <t>A single BGP process with multiple neighbors running.</t>

                  <t>A combination of both.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t>To be aligned with <xref target="RFC8299"/>, this model
              supports the following protocols: <list style="symbols">
                  <t>vrrp: takes only a list of address-family as parameter.
                  VRRP instance is expected to run on the 'vpn-network-access'
                  interface.</t>

                  <t>rip: takes only a list of address-family as parameter.
                  RIP instance is expected to run on the 'vpn-network-access'
                  interface.</t>

                  <t>static: allows user to configure one or more IPv4 and/or
                  IPv6 static routes.</t>

                  <t>bgp: allows to configure a BGP neighbor including
                  parameters like authentication using a key. The
                  authentication type will be driven by the implementation but
                  the module supports any authentication that uses a key as a
                  parameter. A BGP neighbor can support IPv4, IPv6, or both
                  address families. The module supports supplying two
                  neighbors (each for a given address family) or one neighbor
                  (for both IPv4 and IPv6 of "address-family" attribute is set
                  to both). It is then up to the implementation to drive the
                  device configuration.</t>

                  <t>ospf: allows the user to configure OSPF to run on the
                  vpn-network-access interface. An OSPF instance can run ipv4,
                  ipv6 or both. When only ipv4 address-family is requested, it
                  will be up to the implementation to drive if OSPFv2 or v3 is
                  used.</t>

                   <t>IS-IS: allows the user to configure IS-IS to run on the
                  vpn-network-access interface. An IS-IS instance can run L1,
                  L2 or both levels.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t>Routing protocol configuration do not have any routing policy
              configuration. Routing policies are low level device
              configurations that must not be part of an abstracted model.
              Service Provider internal policies (such as security filters)
              will be implemented as part of the device configuration but does
              not require any input from this model. Some policies like
              primary/backup, load-balancing can be inferred from
              access-priority.</t>

                 title="Concept of Import/Export Profiles">
          <t>The import and export profiles construct contains a list with
          information related with route target and distinguishers (RTs and
          RDs), grouped and identified by ie-profile-id. The identifier is
          then referenced in one or multiple vpn-nodes, so the PNC can
          identify RTs and RDs to be configured in the VRF.</t>

        <section anchor="mc" title="Multicast">
          <t>Multicast can be optionally enabled for a particular
          vpn-network-access.</t>

          <t>The model supports a single type of tree (ASM, SSM or
          bidirectional).</t>

          <t>When ASM is used, the model supports configuration of rendez-vous
          points. RP discovery could be static, bsr-rp or auto-rp. When static
          is used RP to multicast grouping mapping must be configured as part
          of the rp-group-mappings container. The RP may be a provider node or
          a customer node. When the RP is a customer node, the RP address must
          be configured using the rp-address leaf otherwise no RP address is
          needed. The model supports RP redundancy through the rp-redundancy
          leaf. How the redundancy is achieved is out of scope and is up to
          the implementation. When a particular VPN using ASM requires a more
          optimal traffic delivery, the leaf optimal-traffic-delivery can be
          used. When set to true, the implementation must use any mechanism to
          provide a more optimal traffic delivery for the customer. As an
          example, the implementation can use RP tree to Shortest Path tree
          switchover or simply deploy additional RPs working in an anycast
          mode.</t>

      <section anchor="mdrmanagement" title="Multi-Domain Resource Management">
        <t>The implementation of L3VPN services which span across
        administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the
        administration of different management systems or controllers)
        requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
        Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and
        manage to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the
        usage of unavailable resources. For example, RTs shall be synchronized
        between PEs. When every PE is controlled by the same management
        system, RT allocation can be performed by the system. In cases where
        the service spans across multiple management systems, this task of
        allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains, therefore, the
        service model must provide a way to specify RTs. In addition, RDs must
        also be synchronized to avoid collisions in RD allocation between
        separate systems. An incorrect allocation might lead to the same RD
        and IP prefixes being exported by different PE routers.</t>

        <t>The L3VPN service defined in this draft provides a multipoint,
        routed service to the customer over an IP/MPLS core. The L3VPNs are
        widely used to deploy 3G/4G, fixed and enterprise services principally
        due to the fact that several traffic discrimination policies can be
        applied in the network to transport and guarantee the right SLAs to
        the mobile customers.</t>

        <t>As it is shown in the <xref target="vpn-service-mbh"/>, commonly
        the eNODEB (CE) is directly connected to the access routers (DCSG) of
        the mobile backhaul and their logical interfaces (one or many
        according to the Service type) are configured in a VPN that transport
        the packets to the mobile core platforms.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
      NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/> .
      The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref
      target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref
      target="RFC8466"/>.</t>

      <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref
      target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to restrict access for particular
      NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
      NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>

      <t>The ietf-l3vpn-ntw module is used to manage L3 VPNs in a service
      provider backbone network. Hence, the module can be used to request,
      modify, or retrieve L3VPN services. For example, the creation of a
      vpn-service leaf instance triggers the creation of an L3 VPN Service in
      a Service Provider Network.</t>

      <t>Due to the foreseen use of the YANG module, there are a number of
      data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
      These data nodes MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
      network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete
      operations to these data nodes without proper protection or
      authentication can have a negative effect on network operations. These
      are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability in
      the ietf-l3vpn-ntw module: <list style="symbols">
          <t>vpn-service: An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
          undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L3 VPN
          Service, interrupting all the traffic of a client. In addition, an
          attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g., QoS,
          bandwidth, routing protocols), leading to malfunctioning of the
          service and therefore to SLA violations. In addition, an attacker
          could attempt to create a L3 VPN Service. Such activity can be
          detected by monitoring and tracking network configuration
          changes.</t>

          <t>COMPLETE rest of critical data nodes and subtrees</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
      notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
      and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>customer-name and ip-connection: An attacker can retrieve
          privacy-related information which can be used to track a customer.
          Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of the
          customer-provider trust relationship.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Summing up, the foreseen risks of using the l3vpn-ntw module can be
      clasified into: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify services</t>

          <t>Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a
          service</t>

          <t>Unauthorized clients attempting to read service information</t>

    <section anchor="Implementation" title="Implementation Status">
      <section title="Nokia Implementation">
        <t>Nokia has a draft implementation of the IETF L3NM model.</t>

        <t>The implementation is a prototype and is currently being planned
        for production.</t>

        <t>Nokia NSP (Network Services Platform) supports integration of
        standard models with the Intent Manager framework. NSP platform
        provides hot pluggable model definitions and implementations which
        would enable defining models where standardization is in progress or
        non-existent. With pluggable architecture for model and implementation
        injections, NSP also serves as a Multi-Layer, Multi-Domain
        controller.</t>

        <t>The Nokia implementation of L3NM covers, the following</t>

        <t>a) RESTConf support</t>

        <t>b) Configuration of L3 IP VPN Services. Create/Get/Query/Delete
        supported on the following operations.</t>

        <t>* Site</t>

        <t>* Site-Bearer</t>

        <t>* VpnService</t>

        <t>* IEProfile</t>

        <t>* VpnNode</t>

        <t>* Site Network Access</t>

        <t>* Site Attachments</t>

        <t>c) Supports translations to the Device Model (Standard /
        Properietary)</t>

        <t>draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-00</t>

        <t>The current implementation is proprietary, so under no terms the
        current implementation can be used.</t>

        <t>NCE V1R19C00</t>

        <t>A brief general description.</t>

        <t>This section provides an implementation report summary for Layer 3
        VPN Network Model. Layer 3 VPN Network Model is available at:
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-00</t>

        <t>The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype, alpha,
        beta, production, widely used, etc.</t>

        <t>Right now, the data model is still subject to change, therefore it
        is still a Prototype, not put into production yet.</t>

        <t>Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are
        implemented.</t>

        <t>We have implemented pruned L3NM model with the following
        parameters</t>

      <section title="Infinera Implementation">
        <t>Infinera has a draft implementation of the IETF L3NM model. The
        implementation is in beta state and is currently being tested and
        integrated with other suppliers controllers supporting this same
        model. Infinera is supporting the L3NM model in its Transcend Maestro
        Multi-layer, Multi-domain Controller.</t>

        <t>The Infinera implementation of L3NM covers discovery and
        configuration of IP VPN services, and is supporting both North-Bound
        (server) and South-Bound (client) functionality. Versions 01 and 02 of
        the model are supported.</t>

        <t>The current implementation is proprietary, so under no terms the
        current implementation can be used.</t>
