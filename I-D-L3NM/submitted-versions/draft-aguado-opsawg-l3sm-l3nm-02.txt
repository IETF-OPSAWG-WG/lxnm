                    draft-aguado-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-01

Abstract

   RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) YANG data model that can
   be used for communication between customers and network operators.
   It assumes that there is a monolithic management system with full
   control of transport resources.  This approach (that is valid for the
   customer to network operator conversation) limits the usage of the
   model to the role of a Customer Service Model, according to the
   terminology defined in RFC8309.

   There is a need for a YANG model for use between the entity that
   interacts directly with the customer (service orchestrator) and the
   entity in charge of network orchestration and control which,
   according to RFC8309, can be referred as Service Delivery Model.  In
   some cases, the control of the network is further expanded into
   perdomain control.

   This document uses the L3SM defined in RFC8299, and extends it to
   facilitate communication between the service orchestrator transport
   orchestrator and domain controllers.  The resulting model is called
   the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8299] defines a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) YANG data model that
   can be used for communication between customers and network
   operators.  Although the intention to provide an abstracted view of
   the customer's requested services is clear, the assumption is that
   the model is applied at the top of a monolithic management system
   with full control of transport resources.  That assumption
   substantially limits the usage of the L3SM to the role of a Customer
   Service Model, according to the terminology defined in [RFC8309].

   The YANG data model defined in this document is called the L3VPN
   Network Model (L3NM).  It enables further capabilities, such as
   resource management or to serve as a multi-domain orchestration
   interface, where transport resources must be synchronized.  The YANG
   module has been built with a prune and extend approach, taking as a
   starting points the YANG model described in [RFC8299].

   This document does not obsolete, but complements, the definitions in
   [RFC8299].  It aims to provide a different scope for the L3SM, but
   does not attempt to address all deployment cases especially those
   where the L3VPN connectivity is supported through the coordination of
   different VPNs in different underlying networks.  More complex
   deployment scenarios involving the coordination of different VPN
   instances and different technologies to provide end-to-end VPN
   connectivity are addressed by a complementary YANG model defined in
   [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8299], [RFC8309], and [RFC8453] and uses
   terminology from those documents.  Tree diagrams used in this
   document follow the notation defined in [RFC8340].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE

   Figure 1 shows where the L3NM is used in a management stack.  The
   figure is an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 5 of
   [RFC8299] and decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that

   figure into three separate functional components called "Service
   Orchestration", "Network Orchestration", and "Domain Orchestration".

   Note that some implementations may choose to construct a monolithic
   orchestration component, but this document assumes that there are
   many benefits for flexiblity of implementation and deployment to
   separate the functional components, and that separation demands the
   existence of sepearate YANG models to be used between the components.

   At the same time, terminology from [RFC8309] is introduced to show
   the distinction between the "Customer Service Model", the "Service
   Delivery Model", the "Network Configuration Model", and the "Device
   Configuration Model".  In that context, the "Domain Orchestration"
   and "Config Manager" roles may be performed by "Controllers".

3.  YANG MODEL EXPLANATION

   The scenarios covered in the L3NM model includes: the integration of
   Ethernet and encapsulation parameters, the extension for transport
   resources (e.g., Route targets and Route distinguishers) to be
   orchestrated from the management system, far-end configuration of PEs

   not managed by the management system and the definition for PE
   identification.

3.1.  STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL

   The YANG module is divided into three main containers: "vpn-
   services","sites" and "vpn-profiles".

3.2.  SITE AND BEARERS

   A site, as per [RFC8299], represents a connection of a customer
   office to one or more VPN services.  As this YANG module, is the
   network view, each site is associated with a list of bearers.  A
   bearer is the layer two connections with the site.  In the module it
   is assumed that the bearer has been allocated by the Service Provider
   (e.g., by the service orchestrator).  The bearer is associated to a
   network element and a port.  Hence, a bearer is not just a bearer-
   reference, but also a true reference to a given port in the service
   provider network.

3.3.  BEARER AND ETHERNET ENCAPSULATION

   The definition of a L3VPN is commonly specified not only at the IP
   layer, but also requires to identify parameters at the Ethernet
   layer, such as encapsulation type (e.g., VLAN, QinQ, QinAny, VxLAN,
   etc.).  This specification is not supported in [RFC8299], whilst it
   suggests that any extension on this direction shall be implemented
   via augmentation of the bearer container.  The extension defined to
   cope with these parameters uses the connection container inside the
   site-network-access defined by the [RFC8466].  This container defines
   protocol parameters to enable connectivity at Layer 2.  In the
   context of L3SM, the augmentation includes only mandatory parameters
   for the service configuration, which are mainly related to the
   interface encapsulation.  Other definitions from L2SM connection
   container are left aside.  For example, Link Aggregation (LAG)
   information is not required and it shall be configured prior to the
   service configuration, being the aggregated interface identified in
   the model as the bearer-reference, as discussed later in Section 3.4.

3.4.  MULTI-DOMAIN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

   The implementation of L3VPN services which span across
   administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the
   administration of different management systems or controllers)
   requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
   Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and
   manage to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the
   usage of unavailable resources.  For example, RTs shall be

Internet-Draft                    l3nm                       August 2019


   synchronized between PEs.  When every PE is controlled by the same
   management system, RT allocation can be performed by the system.  In
   cases where the service spans across multiple management systems,
   this task of allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains,
   therefore, the service model must provide a way to specify RTs.  In
   addition, RDs must also be synchronized to avoid collisions in RD
   allocation between separate systems.  An incorrect allocation might
   lead to the same RD and IP prefixes being exported by different PE
   routers.

3.5.  REMOTE FAR-END CONFIGURATION

   Depending on the control plane implementation, different network
   scenarios might require additional information for the L3VPN service
   to be configured and active.  For example, an L3VPN Option C service,
   if no reflection of IPv4 VPN routes is configured via ASBR or route
   reflector, may require additional configuration (e.g. a new BGP
   neighbor) to be coordinated between both management systems.  This
   definition requires for every management system participant in the
   VPN to receive not just their own sites and site-network-accesses,
   but also to receive information about external ones, identified as an
   external site-network-access-type.  In addition, this particular
   site-network-access is augmented to include the loopback address of
   the far-end (remote/external) PE router.

3.6.  PROVIDE EDGE IDENTIFICATION POINT

   [RFC8299] states that the "bearer-reference" parameter is used in
   cases where the customer has already ordered a network connection to
   the service provider (SP) apart from the IP VPN site and wants to
   reuse this connection.  The string used is an internal reference from
   the SP and describes the already-available connection.  Usually, a
   client interface (either a customer one or an interface used by the
   SP) is already in place and connected, although it has not being use
   previously.  In some other cases (e.g., for stitching purposes), the
   termination of a VPN service is done over logical terminations within
   a PE router.

   The bearer-reference must serve as a strict unequivocal parameters to
   identify the connection between a PE and a client (CE).  This means
   that, despite the type is maintained as a string and there is no
   restriction in the way this data is formed, the bearer-reference must
   serve as the unique way to identify the PE router and the client
   interface.  This, together with the encapsulation augments proposed
   in Section 3.2, serves as the way to identify the client interface
   and configure L2 specific parameters.

4.  DESING OF THE DATA MODEL

   The augmentations defined in this document are organised per
   scenario, as defined in Section 3.  The case described Section 3.4
   does not need any further extension of the data model and only
   requires a more restricted definition on how the data model is used
   for PE router and client port identification, so no augmentation is
   implemented for this scenario.

   The augmentations implemented are distributed as follows:

   o  An extension including RT and RD definition for the L3VPN,
      following the YANG definitions from BESS-L3VPN.  This extension
      was developed creating a container "ie-profiles" under the VPN
      Service.  All the import-export information can be created and
      reused for several VPN-Nodes.

      *  If the "ie-profile" is empty the domain controller should
         automatically assing RD and RTs.  This is not valid for a
         multi-domain scenario

   o  The second augmentation copes with the information from a remote
      PE not directly under management system supervision.  This
      augmentation does not follow any previously defined model and
      includes the loopback IP address of the external router.

   o  The third augmentation copes with a pseudowire termination under a
      VPN service.  This termination requires the management of the
      Virtual Circuit Identifier under the VPN service.

   o  Access-group-id has been added within the site network access in
      order to allow associations between interfaces that have similar
      behaviors.  For example, identify two interfaces in dual homing
      distribution.

   o  The last augmentation includes information below layer 3 that is
      required for the service.  In particular, we include information
      related to clients interface encapsulation and aggregation.

   The high-level model structure defined by this document is as shown
   below:
