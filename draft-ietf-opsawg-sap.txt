           A Network YANG Model for Service Attachment Points
                        draft-ietf-opsawg-sap-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract
   view of the provider network topology containing the points from
   which its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN,
   network slices).  The data model augments the 'ietf-network' data
   model by adding the concept of service attachment points (SAPs).  The
   service attachment points are the points to which network services
   (such as L3VPN or L2VPN) can be attached.  The customer endpoint of
   an attachment circuits are not covered in the SAP network topology.

1.  Introduction

   The service attachment point (SAP) is an important architectural
   concept in many implementations and deployments of services such as
   VPNs, SDWAN, or managed VoIP services.  It has already been used to
   decide where to attach and, thus, deliver the service in the L3SM
   [RFC8299] and the L2SM [RFC8466].

   This document defines a YANG network model for representing,
   managing, and controlling the service attachment points (SAPs).  The
   data model augments the 'ietf-network' module [RFC8345] by adding the
   concept of service attachment points.  The service attachment points
   are abstraction of the points where network services such as L3VPNs
   or L2VPNs can be attached.

   This document does not make any assumption about the service provided
   by the network to the users.  VPN services are used for illustration
   purposes.  This concept can also be used to decide network slice SAPs
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   In the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
   [RFC7149][RFC7426], the defined YANG data model in this document can

Internet-Draft              SAP Network YANG                January 2022


   be used to exchange information between control elements, so as to
   support VPN service provision and resource management discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm][I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm].  Through this data
   model, the service orchestration layer can learn the available
   endpoints (i.e., SAPs) of interconnection resource of the underlying
   network.

   The service orchestration layer can determine which endpoint of
   interconnection to add to L2VPN or L3VPN service.  With the help of
   other data models (e.g., L3SM [RFC8299] or L2SM [RFC8466]),
   hierarchical control elements could determine the feasibility of an
   end-to-end IP connectivity or L2VPN connectivity and therefore derive
   the sequence of domains and the points of interconnection to use.

   This document explains the scope and purpose of a SAP network model
   and its relation with the service models and describes how it can be
   used by a network operator.  The document also shows how the topology
   and service models fit together.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], and [RFC8309].  The document uses terms from
   those documents.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

   This document uses the following terms:

   Service Provider (SP):   The organization responsible for operating
      the network that offers a service (e.g., a VPN) to customers.

   Customer Edge (CE):   An equipment that is dedicated to a particular
      customer and is directly connected to one or more Provider Edges
      (PEs) via attachment circuits (ACs).  A CE is usually located at

Internet-Draft              SAP Network YANG                January 2022


      the customer premises.  A CE may be dedicated to a single service
      (e.g., L3VPN), although it may support multiple VPNs if each one
      has separate attachment circuits.  A CE can be a router, bridge,
      switch, etc.

   Provider Edge (PE):   An equipment owned and managed by the SP that
      can support multiple services (e.g., VPNs) for different
      customers.  A PE is directly connected to one or more CEs via
      attachment circuits.  A PE is usually located at an SP point of
      presence (PoP).

   Attachment point (AP):    Describes a service's end point
      characteristics and its reference to a Termination Point (TP) of
      the PE; used as service access point for service.

3.  SAP Network Model Usage

   Management operations of a service provider network can be automated
   using a variety of means such as interfaces based on YANG modules
   [RFC8969].  From that standpoint, and considering the architecture
   depicted in Figure 1, the goal of this document is to provide a
   mechanism to show via a YANG-based interface an abstracted network
   view from the network controller to the service orchestration layer
   with a focus on where a service can be delivered to customers.

   Let us consider the example of a typical service provider network
   (Figure 2), with PE and P nodes.

                      +---------+         +---------+
                      |   PE1   |         |   PE2   |
                      +---------+         +---------+
                                 \       /
                                 +------+
                                 |  P   |
                                 +------+
                                /        \
                      +---------+         +---------+
                      |   PE3   |         |   PE4   |
                      +---------+         +---------+

                     Figure 2: Sample Network Topology

   The Service Orchestration layer does not need to know about the
   internals of the underlying network (e.g., P nodes).  Figure 3 shows
   the abstract network view as seen by the Service Orchestrator.
   However, this view is not enough to provide to the Service
   Orchestration layer the information to create services in the
   network.  The service topology need is to be able to expose the set
   of nodes and the attachment points associated with the nodes from
   which network services can be grafted (delivered).

                      +---------+         +---------+
                      |   PE1   |         |   PE2   |
                      +---------+         +---------+


                      +---------+         +---------+
                      |   PE3   |         |   PE4   |
                      +---------+         +---------+

                    Figure 3: Abstract Network Topology

   The Service Orchestration layer would see a set of PEs and a set of
   client-facing interfaces (physical or logical) to which CEs can be
   connected (or are actually connected).  The Service Orchestration
   layer can use them to setup the requested services or to commit the
   delivery of a service.  Figure 4 depicts the SAP network topology
   that is maintained by the network controller and exposed to the
   Service Orchestration.

                      Figure 4: SAP Network Topology

   A single SAP network topology can be used for one of multiple service
   types (e.g., L3VPN, EVPN).  The network controller can then expose
   the service type(s) and associated interfaces via the SAPs.

   As shown in Figure 5, the Service Orchestration layer will have also
   access to a set of Customer Service Model, e.g., an L3SM or L2SM data
   model in the customer-facing interface and a set of network models,
   e.g., L3NM and Network topology data models in the resource-facing
   interface.  In this use case, it is assumed that the network
   controller is unaware of what happens beyond the PEs towards the CEs;
   it is only responsible for the management and control of the network
   between PEs.

4.  SAP Module Tree Structure

   The SAP network model builds on the network data model defined in the
   'ietf-network' module [RFC8345], augmenting the nodes with service
   attachment points, which anchor the links and are contained in nodes.
   The 'service-attachment-point' attribute defined in the SAP network
   model is not a tunnel termination point (TTP) nor a link, but an
   abstraction of the termination point defined in [RFC8345].

   The structure of the 'ietf-sap-ntw' module is shown in Figure 6.

   A SAP network topology can be used for one single service type or
   multiple types ("sap-type").  When a SAP topology is used for many
   service types, the underlying nodes must support at least one of
   these service types.  Examples of supported service types are listed
   below:

   o  L3VPN,

   o  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) using BGP [RFC4761],

   o  VPLS using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC4762],

   o  Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) [RFC8214],

   o  BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN [RFC7432],

   o  Ethernet VPN (EVPN) [RFC8365],

   o  Provider Backbone Bridging Combined with Ethernet VPN (PBB-EVPN)
      [RFC7623],

   o  Virtual Networks [RFC8453],

   o  Enhanced VPN (VPN+) [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], and

   o  Network slice [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   A service attachment point is identified by an interface name
   ("attachment-id"), an interface type ("type"), a status ("admin-
   status", and "oper-status"), an encapsulation type ("encapsulation-
   type"), one or a list of service types ("sap-type") such as L3VPN or

   network slice, a description of the service(s) ("service-
   description").

5.  Relation with other Models

   The SAP network model can be seen as an inventory data associated
   with service attachment points.  The model maintains an inventory of
   nodes contained in a network based on [RFC8345].

          Figure 7: Relation of SAP Network Model to Other Models

   Figure 7 depicts the relationship of the SAP network model to other
   models.  The SAP network model augments from the Network model
   [RFC8345] and imports Network Topology model, while other technology-
   specific topology models (e.g., TE Topologies model [RFC8795] or L3
   Topology model [RFC8346]) augment from the Network Topology.

   This document registers the following namespace URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

       maintained by IANA: N
       prefix: sap
       reference: RFC XXXX

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative

   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/sap:service-attachment-point/
      sap:attachment-id

   This subtree specifies the configurations of the nodes in a SAP
   network model.  Unexpected changes to this subtree could lead to
   service disruption and/or network misbehavior.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/sap:service-attachment-point

      Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the operational
      state information of the nodes in a SAP network model.
