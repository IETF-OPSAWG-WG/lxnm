1.  Introduction

   The IETF has specified YANG data modules for VPN services, e.g.,
   Layer 3 VPN Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299] or Layer 2 VPN Service
   Model (L2SM) [RFC8466].  Other relevant YANG models are the Layer 3
   VPN Network Model (L3NM) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm] and the Layer 2
   VPN Network Model (L2NM) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm].  There are common
   data nodes and structures that are present in all of these models or
   at least a subset of them.

   This document defines a common YANG module that is meant to be reused
   by various VPN-related modules such as L3NM
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm] and L2NM [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm]: "ietf-
   vpn-common" (Section 4).

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module includes a set of identities, types, and
   groupings that are meant to be reused by other VPN-related YANG
   modules independently of their layer (e.g., Layer 2, Layer 3) and the
   type of the module (e.g., network model, service model) including
   possible future revisions of existing models (e.g., L3SM [RFC8299] or
   L2SM [RFC8466]).

2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG modules is defined in [RFC7950].

   The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

   The reader may refer to [RFC4026] and [RFC4176] for VPN-related
   terms.

   The document inherits many terms from [RFC8299] and [RFC8466] (e.g.,
   Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency
   Communications (URLLC), Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)).

3.  Description of the VPN Common YANG Module

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module defines a set of common VPN-related
   features, including:

   Encapsulation features such as:

      *  Dot1q [IEEE802.1Q],

      *  QinQ [IEEE802.1ad],

      *  link aggregation [IEEE802.1AX], and

      *  Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) [RFC7348].

   Multicast [RFC6513].

   Routing features such as:

      *  BGP [RFC4271],

      *  OSPF [RFC4577][RFC6565],

      *  IS-IS [ISO10589],

      *  RIP [RFC2080][RFC2453],

      *  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880][RFC7880],
         and

      *  Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798].

   Also, the module defines a set of identities, including:

   'service-type':  Used to identify the VPN service type.  Examples of
      supported service types are:

      *  L3VPN,

      *  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) using BGP [RFC4761],

      *  VPLS using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC4762],

      *  Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) [RFC8214],

      *  BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN [RFC7432],

      *  Ethernet VPN (EVPN) [RFC8365], and

      *  Provider Backbone Bridging Combined with Ethernet VPN (PBB-
         EVPN) [RFC7623].

   'vpn-signaling-type':  Used to identify the signaling mode used for a
      given service type.  Examples of supported VPN signaling types
      are:

      *  L2VPNs using BGP [RFC6624].

      *  LDP [RFC5036], and

      *  Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC3931].

   The module covers both IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC8200] identities.
   It also includes multicast related identities such as Internet Group
   Management Protocol version 1 (IGMPv1) [RFC1112], IGMPv2 [RFC2236],
   IGMPv3 [RFC3376], Multicast Listener Discovery version 1 (MLDv1)
   [RFC2710], MLDv2 [RFC3810], and Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
   [RFC7761].

   The reader should refer to Section 4 for the full list of supported
   identities (identities related to address families, VPN topologies,
   network access types, operational and administrative status, site or
   node roles, VPN service constraints, routing protocols, routes
   imports and exports, bandwidth and Quality of Service (QoS), etc.).

                         Figure 1: VPN Common Tree

   The description of the common groupings is provided below:

   'vpn-description':

         A YANG grouping that provides common administrative VPN
         information such as an identifier, a name, a textual
         description, and a customer name.

   'vpn-profile-cfg':

         A YANG grouping that defines a set of valid profiles
         (encryption, routing, forwarding, etc.) that can be bound to a
         Layer 2/3 VPN.  This document does not make any assumption
         about the structure of such profiles, but allows "gluing" a VPN
         service with other parameters that can be required locally to
         provide added value features to requesting customers.

         For example, a service provider may provide an external
         connectivity to a VPN customer (e.g., to a private or public

         cloud, Internet).  Such service may involve tweaking both
         filtering and NAT rules (e.g., bind a Virtual Routing and
         Forwarding (VRF) interface with a NAT instance as discussed in
         Section 2.10 of [RFC8512]).  These added value features may be
         bound to all or a subset of network accesses.  Some of these
         added value features may be implemented in nodes other than PEs
         (e.g., a P node or even a dedicated node that hosts the NAT
         function).

         It is out of the scope of this document to elaborate the
         structure of these profiles.

   'oper-status-timestamp':

         A YANG grouping that defines the operational status updates of
         a VPN service or component.

   'service-status':

         A YANG grouping that defines the administrative and operational
         status of a component.  The grouping can be applied to the
         whole service or an endpoint.

   'underlay-transport':

         A YANG grouping that defines the type of the underlay transport
         for a VPN service or how that underlay is set.

         The underlay transport can be expressed as an abstract
         transport instance (e.g., an identifier of a VPN+ instance
         [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], a virtual network identifier
         [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang][RFC8453], or a network slice name
         [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices]) or as an ordered list of
         the actual protocols to be enabled in the network.

         The module supports a rich set of protocol identifiers that can
         be used, e.g., to refer to an underlay transport.  Examples of
         supported protocols are:

         +  IP-in-IP [RFC2003][RFC2473],

         +  GRE [RFC1701][RFC1702][RFC7676],

         +  MPLS-in-UDP [RFC7510],

         +  Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (GENEVE)
            [RFC8926],

         +  Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8660][RFC8663][RFC8754],

         +  Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) with traffic
            engineering extensions [RFC3209], and

         +  BGP with labeled prefixes [RFC8277].

   'vpn-route-targets':

         A YANG grouping that defines Route Target (RT) import/export
         rules used in a BGP-enabled VPN (e.g., [RFC4364][RFC4664]).
         Note that this is modelled as a list to ease the reuse of this
         grouping in modules where a pointer is needed (e.g., associate
         an operator with RTs).

   'route-distinguisher':

         A YANG grouping that defines Route Distinguishers (RDs).

         As depicted in Figure 2, the module supports these RD
         assignment modes: direct assignment, automatic assignment from
         a given pool, automatic assignment, and no assignment.

         Also, the module accommodates deployments where only the
         Assigned Number subfield of RDs (Section 4.2 of [RFC4364]) is
         assigned from a pool while the Administrator subfield is set
         to, e.g., the router-id that is assigned to a VPN node.  The
         module supports these modes for managing the Assigned Number
         subfield: explicit assignment, auto-assignment from a pool, and
         full auto-assignment.

   'vpn-components-group':

         A YANG grouping that is used to group VPN nodes, VPN network
         accesses, or sites.  For example, diversity or redundancy
         constraints can be applied on a per-group basis.

   'placement-constraints':

         A YANG grouping that is used to define the placement
         constraints of a VPN node, VPN network access, or site.

   'ports':

         A YANG grouping that defines ranges of source and destination
         port numbers and operators.  The subtree of this grouping is
         depicted in Figure 3.

                  Figure 3: Port Numbers Grouping Subtree

   'qos-classification-policy':

         A YANG grouping that defines a set of QoS classification
         policies based on various match Layer 3/4 and application
         criteria.  The subtree of this grouping is depicted in
         Figure 4.

         The QoS match criteria reuse groupings that are defined in the
         packet fields module "ietf-packet-fields" (Section 4.2 of
         [RFC8519]).

         Any layer 4 protocol can be indicated in the 'protocol' data
         node under 'l3', but only TCP and UDP specific match criteria
         are elaborated in this version as these protocols are widely
         used in the context of VPN services.  Future revisions can be
         considered to add other Layer 4 specific parameters (e.g.,
         Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960]), if needed.

         Some transport protocols use existing protocols (e.g., TCP or
         UDP) as substrate.  The match criteria for such protocols may
         rely upon the 'protocol' under 'l3', TCP/UDP match criteria
         shown in Figure 4, part of the TCP/UDP payload, or a
         combination thereof.  This version of the module does not
         support such advanced match criteria.  Future revisions of the

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module defines a set of identities, types, and
   groupings.  These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
   modules.  The module does not expose by itself any data nodes which

   are writable, contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As such, there are
   no additional security issues to be considered relating to the "ietf-
   vpn-common" module.

   Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
   information (e.g., customer-name).  Disclosing such information may
   be considered as a violation of the customer-provider trust
   relationship.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vpn-common
         Registrant Contact: The IESG.
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

         name: ietf-vpn-common
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vpn-common
         maintained by IANA: N
         prefix: vpn-common
         reference: RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Example of Common Data Nodes in Early L2NM/L3NM Designs

   In order to avoid data nodes duplication and to ease passing data
   among layers (i.e., from the service layer to the network layer and
   vice versa), early versions of the L3NM reused many of the data nodes
   that are defined in the L3SM.  Nevertheless, that approach was
   abandoned because that design was interpreted as if the deployment of
   L3NM depends on L3SM, while this is not required.  For example, a
   service provider may decide to use the L3NM to build its L3VPN
   services without exposing the L3SM to customers.

   Likewise, early versions of the L2NM reused many of the data nodes
   that are defined in both L2SM and L3NM.  An example of L3NM groupings
   reused in L2NM is shown in Figure 5.  Such data nodes reuse was
   interpreted as if the deployment of the L2NM requires the support of
   the L3NM; which is not required.
