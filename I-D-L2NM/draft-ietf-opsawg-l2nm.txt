                    A Layer 2 VPN Network YANG Model
                     draft-ietf-opsawg-l2nm-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model (called, L2NM) that can be
   used to manage the provisioning of Layer 2 VPN services within a
   service provider Network.  The L2NM provides representation of the
   Layer 2 VPN services from a network standpoint.  The L2NM is meant to
   be used by a network controller to derive the configuration
   information that will be sent to relevant network devices.

   The L2NM complements the Layer 2 Service Model by providing a
   network-centric view of the service that is internal to a service
   providers.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8466] defines an L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) YANG data model that
   can be used for L2VPN service ordering matters between customers and
   service providers (SPs).  This document complements the L2SM by
   creating a network-centric view of the service which can be exposed
   by a network to a service controller within the service providers
   network.  In particular, the model can be used in the communication
   between the entity that interacts directly with the customer, the
   service orchestrator, (either fully automated or a human operator)
   and the entity in charge of network orchestration and control
   (a.k.a., network controller/orchestrator).

   The data model defined in this document is called the L2VPN Network
   Model (L2NM), playing the role of Service Delivery Model (Figure 3 of
   [RFC8466]).  The module supports additional capabilities, such as
   exposing operational parameters, transport protocols selection and
   precedence.  It also serves as a multi-domain orchestration
   interface, because this model can transport resources (i.e., VCID)
   between domains.  The data model keeps minimum customer-related
   information.

   This document uses the common VPN YANG module defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8466], [RFC8309], and uses terminology
   from those documents.

Internet-Draft                    L2NM                        April 2021


   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

   The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams is [RFC8340].

   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   L2 VPN Customer Service Model (L2SM):  Describes the service
      characterization of an L2VPN that interconnects a set of sites
      from the perspective of the customer.  The customer service model
      does not provide details on the service provider network.  The
      L2VPN customer service model is defined in [RFC8466].

   L2 VPN Service Network Model (L2NM):  Refers to the YANG module that
      describes an L2VPN service with a network-centric view.  It
      contains information of the service providers network and might
      include allocated resources.  It can be used by network
      controllers to manage the Layer 2 VPN service configuration in the
      service providers network.  The YANG module can be consumed by a
      service orchestrator to request a VPN service to a network
      controller or to expose the list of active L2VPN services.

   Service orchestrator:  Refers to a functional entity that interacts
      with the customer of an L2VPN relying upon, e.g., L2SM.  The
      service orchestrator is responsible of the CE-PE attachment
      circuits, the PE selection, and requesting the activation of the
      L2VPN service to a network controller.

   Network controller:  Denotes a functional entity responsible for the
      management of the service providers network.

   VPN node:  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied on a PE and that belong to a single VPN service.  A VPN
      service involves one or more VPN nodes.  The VPN node will
      identify the service providers node on which the VPN is deployed.

   VPN network access:  Is an abstraction that represents the network
      interfaces that are associated to a given VPN node.  Traffic
      coming from the VPN network access belongs to the VPN.  The
      attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs are terminated
      in the VPN network access.

   VPN Service Provider (SP):  Is a service providers that offers L2VPN-
      related services.

   Service Provider Network (SP Network):  Is a network able to provide
      L2VPN-related services.

3.  Acronyms

   The following acronyms are used in the document:

   ACL     Access Control List
   BGP     Border Gateway Protocol
   CE      Customer Edge
   L2VPN   Layer 2 Virtual Private Network
   L2SM    L2VPN Service Model
   L2NM    L2VPN Network Model
   PE      Provider Edge
   QoS     Quality of Service
   RD      Route Distinguisher
   RT      Route Target
   VPN     Virtual Private Network
   VRF     Virtual Routing and Forwarding

4.  Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates how L2NM is used.  As a reminder, this figure is
   an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 3 of [RFC8466]
   and decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that figure into
   three separate functional components called "Service Orchestration",
   "Network Orchestration", and "Domain Orchestration".

   The reader may refer to [RFC8309] for the distinction between the
   "Customer Service Model", the "Service Delivery Model", the "Network
   Configuration Model", and the "Device Configuration Model".  The
   "Domain Orchestration" and "Config Manager" roles may be performed by
   "SDN Controllers".

   The customer may use a variety of means to request a service that may
   trigger the instantiation of a L2NM.  The customer may use the L2SM
   or may rely upon more abstract models to request a service that
   relies upon an L3VPN service.  For example, the customer may supply
   an IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) [RFC7297], an enhanced
   VPN (VPN+) service [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], or an IETF network
   slice [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Note also that both the L2SM and the L2NM may be used in the context
   of the Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture
   [RFC8453].  Figure 2 shows the Customer Network Controller (CNC), the
   Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC), and the Provisioning Network
   Controller (PNC).

5.  Relation with other YANG Models

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] includes a
   set of identities, types, and groupings that are meant to be reused
   by VPN-related YANG modules independently of the layer (e.g., Layer
   2, Layer 3) and the type of the module (e.g., network model, service

   model) including future revisions of existing models (e.g.,
   [RFC8466]).  The L2NM reuses these common types and groupings.

   As discussed in Section 4, the L2NM is meant to manage L2VPN services
   within a service provider network.  The module provides a network
   view of the service.  Such a view is only visible within the service
   provider and is not exposed outside (to customers, for example).  The
   following discusses how L2NM interfaces with other YANG modules:

   L2SM:  L2NM is not a customer service model.

      The internal view of the service (i.e., L2NM) may be mapped to an
      external view which is visible to customers: L2VPN Service YANG
      data Model (L2SM) [RFC8466].

      The L2NM can be fed with inputs that are requested by customers,
      typically, relying upon an L2SM template.  Concretely, some parts
      of the L2SM module can be directly mapped into L2NM while other
      parts are generated as a function of the requested service and
      local guidelines.  Some other parts are local to the service
      provider and do not map directly to L2SM.

      Note that the use of L2NM within a service provider does not
      assume nor preclude exposing the VPN service via the L2SM.  This
      is deployment-specific.  Nevertheless, the design of L2NM tries to
      align as much as possible with the features supported by the L2SM
      to ease grafting both L2NM and L2SM for the sake of highly
      automated VPN service provisioning and delivery.

   Network Topology Modules:  An L2VPN involves nodes that are part of a
      topology managed by the service provider network.  Such topology
      can be represented using the network topology module in [RFC8345].

   Device Modules:  L2NM is not a device model.

      Once a global VPN service is captured by means of the L2NM, the
      actual activation and provisioning of the VPN service will involve
      a variety of device modules to tweak the required functions for
      the delivery of the service.  These functions are supported by the
      VPN nodes and can be managed using device YANG modules.

      How the L2NM is used to derive device-specific actions is
      implementation-specific.

6.  Description of the L2NM YANG Module

   The L2NM module ('ietf-l2vpn-ntw') is meant to manage L2VPNs within a
   service provider network.  In particular, the 'ietf-l2vpn-ntw' module
   can be used to create, modify, and retrieve L2VPN services in a
   network controller.  The module is not aimed at maintaining customer-
   related information.

   Editor's note: Next version of the document will include the full
   description of the parameters.  When the parameters match with L2SM,
   the exact reference will be done

6.1.  Structure of the Module

   The 'ietf-l2vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers: 'vpn-services'
   and 'vpn-profiles'.  The 'vpn-services' container maintains a set of
   L2VPN services managed in the service providers network.  The module
   allows to create a new L2VPN service by adding a new instance of
   'vpn-service'.  The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that
   abstracts the VPN Service.

6.2.  VPN Profiles

   The 'vpn-profiles' container (Figure 4) allows the VPN service
   provider to define and maintain a set of VPN profiles
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] that apply to one or several VPN
   services.

   This document does not make any assumption about the exact definition
   of these profiles.  The exact definition of the profiles is local to
   each VPN service provider.  The model only includes an identifier to
   these profiles in order to ease identifying and binding local

   policies when building a VPN service.  As shown in Figure 4, the
   following identifiers can be included:

   'external-connectivity-identifier':  This identifier refers to a
      profile that defines the external connectivity provided to a VPN
      service (or a subset of VPN sites).  An external connectivity may
      be an access to the Internet or a restricted connectivity such as
      access to a public/private cloud.

   'encryption-profile-identifier':  An encryption profile refers to a
      set of policies related to the encryption schemes and setup that
      can be applied when building and offering a VPN service.

   'qos-profile-identifier':  A Quality of Service (QoS) profile refers
      to as set of policies such as classification, marking, and actions
      (e.g., [RFC3644]).

   'bfd-profile-identifier':  A Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      profile refers to a set of BFD [RFC5880] policies that can be
      invoked when building a VPN service.

   'forwarding-profile-identifier':  A forwarding profile refers to the
      policies that apply to the forwarding of packets conveyed within a
      VPN.  Such policies may consist, for example, at applying Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).

   'routing-profile-identifier':  A routing profile refers to a set of
      routing policies that will be invoked (e.g., BGP policies) when
      delivering the VPN service.

6.3.  L2VPN Service

   The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that abstracts a VPN service
   in the service provider network.  Each 'vpn-service' is uniquely
   identified by an identifier: 'vpn-id'.  Such 'vpn-id' is only
   meaningful locally within the network controller.  The subtree of the
   'vpn-services' is shown in Figure 5.

   The description of the VPN service data nodes that are depicted in
   Figure 5 are as follows:

   'vpn-id':  Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the
      L2VPN service within L2NM scope.

   'vpn-name':  Associates a name with the service in order to
      facilitate the identification of the service.

   'vpn-description':  Includes a textual description of the service.

      The internal structure of a VPN description is local to each VPN
      service provider.

   'customer-name':  Indicates the name of the customer who ordered the
      service.

   'parent-service-id':  Refers to an identifier of the parent service
      (e.g, L2SM, IETF network slice, VPN+) that triggered the creation
      of the VPN service.  This identifier is used to easily correlate
      the (network) service as built in the network with a service
      order.  A controller can use that correlation to enrich or
      populate some fields (e.g., description fields) as a function of
      local deployments.

   'vpn-type':  Indicates the VPN type.  Typically, the following types
      can be used for the L2NM [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common]:

      'vpls':   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) as defined in
         [RFC4761] or [RFC4762].

      'vpws':   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) as defined in
         Section 3.1.1 of [RFC4664].

      'vpws-evpn':   VPWS as defined in [RFC8214].

      'pbb-evpn':   Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) EVPNs as defined in
         [RFC7623].

      'mpls-evpn':   MPLS-based EVPNs [RFC7432].

      'vxlan-evpn':   VXLAN based EVPNs [RFC8365].

   'vpn-service-topology':  Indicates the network topology for the
      service: hub-spoke, any-to-any, or custom.

   'global-parameters-profiles':  Defines reusable parameters for the
      same 'vpn-service'.

      More details are provided in Section 6.3.1.

   'underlay-transport':  Describes the preference for the transport
      technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.  This
      preference is especially useful in networks with multiple domains
      and Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) types.  The underlay
      transport can be expressed as an abstract transport instance
      (e.g., an identifier of a VPN+ instance, a virtual network
      identifier, or a network slice name) or as an ordered list of the
      actual protocols to be enabled in the network.

      A rich set of protocol identifiers that can be used to refer to an
      underlay transport are defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   'status':  Is used to track the service status of a given VPN
      service.  Both operational and administrative status are
      maintained together with a timestamp.  For example, a service can
      be created, but not put into effect.

      Administrative and operational status can be used as a trigger to
      detect service anomalies.  For example, a service that is declared
      at the service layer as being active but still inactive at the
      network layer is an indication that network provision actions are
      needed to align the observed service status with the expected
      service status.

   'vpn-node':  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied to a network node and that belong to a single 'vpn-
      service'.  A VPN service is typically built by adding instances of
      'vpn-node' to the 'vpn-nodes' container.

      A 'vpn-node' contains 'vpn-network-accesses', which are the
      interfaces attached to the VPN by which the customer traffic is
      received.  Therefore, the customer sites are connected to the
      'vpn-network-accesses'.

      Note that, as this is a network data model, the information about
      customers sites is not required in the model.  Such information is
      rather relevant in the L2SM.  Whether that information is included
      in the L2NM, e.g., to populate the various 'description' data node
      is implementation specific.

      More details are provided in Section 6.3.2.

   'vpn-node-id':  Is an identifier that uniquely identifies a node that
      enables a VPN network access.

   'description':  Provides a textual description of the VPN node.

      VPN parameters profiles for this VPN node.  Concretely, one or
      more global profiles that are defined at the VPN service level can
      be activated at the VPN node level; each of these profiles is

      the ones defined in the VPN service level.

   'signaling-options':  See Section 6.3.2.1.

   'status':  Tracks the status of a node involved in a VPN service.
      Both operational and administrative status are maintained.  A
      mismatch between the administrative status vs. the operational
      status can be used as a trigger to detect anomalies.

   'vpn-network-accesses':  Represents the point to which sites are
      connected.

      Note that, unlike in L2SM, the L2NM does not need to model the
      customer site, only the points where the traffic from the site are
      received (i.e., the PE side of PE-CE connections).  Hence, the VPN
      network access contains the connectivity information between the
      provider's network and the customer premises.  The VPN profiles
      ('vpn-profiles') have a set of routing policies that can be
      applied during the service creation.

      See Section 6.3.2.2 for more details.

6.3.2.1.  Signaling Options

   This sub-tree defines the L2VPN service type, according to the
   several signalling options to exchange membership information between
   PEs of an L2VPN.  The following signaling options are supported:

   'l2vpn-bgp':  Refers to the BGP control plane as described in
      [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].

6.3.2.2.  VPN Network Access

   A 'vpn-network-access' represents an entry point to a VPN service .
   In other words, this container encloses the parameters that describe
   the access information for the traffic that belongs to a particular
   L2VPN.  As such, every 'vpn-network-access' MUST belong to one and
   only one 'vpn-node'.

   A 'vpn-network-access' includes information such as the connection on
   which the access is defined , the specific layer 2 service
   requirements, etc.

   The VPN network access is comprised of:

   'id':  Identifier of the VPN network access.

   'description':  Text describing the VPN network access.

   'status':  Administrative and operational status of the service.

   'ethernet-service-oam':  Carries information about the service OAM.

   properties of the interface that is attached to the VPN, for example,
   the encapsulation type, the lag creation, or the relation ship
   between 'vpn-network-accesses'.

   'encapsulation':  Contains the layer 2 encapsulation properties of a
      VPN network access (e.g., IP dot1q, qinq or vxlan).

   'lag-interface':  Includes the Link Aggregation Protocol (LACP)
      configuration attributes including as main attributes the LACP-
      Mode, LACP-Speed and Members.

   'group':  Group container allows spanning several 'vpn-network-
      accesses' based on the group identifier attribute.  The 'vpn-
      netwrok-accesses' related to the same customer/service SHOULD have
      the same group-id.  In that case, the precedence attribute SHOULD
      be used to differentiate the Primary and Secondary accesses for
      that service.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] . The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or

   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "ietf-l2vpn-ntw" module:

   o  'vpn-service': An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
      undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L2VPN
      service, interrupting all the traffic of a client.  In addition,
      an attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g.,
      QoS, bandwidth), leading to malfunctioning of the service and
      therefore to SLA violations.  In addition, an attacker could
      attempt to create an L2VPN service or adding a new network access.
      Such activity can be detected by adequately monitoring and
      tracking network configuration changes.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'customer-name' and 'ip-connection': An attacker can retrieve
      privacy-related information which can be used to track a customer.
      Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of
      the customer-provider trust relationship.

   The following summarizes the foreseen risks of using the "ietf-l2vpn-
   ntw" module can be classified into:

   o  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify VPN services.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a VPN
      service.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to read VPN service related
      information.
