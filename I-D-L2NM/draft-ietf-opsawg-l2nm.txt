                    A Layer 2 VPN Network YANG Model
                     draft-ietf-opsawg-l2nm-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an L2VPN Network YANG Model (L2NM) that can be
   used to manage the provisioning of Layer 2 Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) services within a service provider Network.  The L2NM provides
   representation of the Layer 2 VPN services from a network standpoint.
   The L2NM is meant to be used by a network controller to derive the
   configuration information that will be sent to relevant network
   devices.

   The L2NM complements the Layer 2 Service Model by providing a
   network-centric view of the service that is internal to a service
   providers.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8466] defines an L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) YANG data model that
   can be used for Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) service
   ordering matters between customers and service providers (SPs).  This
   document complements the L2SM by creating a network-centric view of
   the service: the L2VPN Network Model (L2NM).

   The L2NM can be exposed, for example, by a network to a service
   controller within the service providers network.  In particular, the
   model can be used in the communication between the entity that
   interacts directly with the customer, the service orchestrator
   (either fully automated or a human operator), and the entity in
   charge of network orchestration and control (a.k.a., network
   controller/orchestrator).

   The L2NM supports additional capabilities, such as exposing
   operational parameters, transport protocols selection and precedence.
   It also serves as a multi-domain orchestration interface.

   This document uses the common VPN YANG module defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   The YANG data models in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

   A set of examples to ilustrate the use of the L2MN is provided in
   Appendix A.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8466], [RFC8309], and uses terminology
   from those documents.

   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

   The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams is [RFC8340].

   This document uses the term "network model" defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8969].

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   L2 VPN Customer Service Model (L2SM):  Describes the service
      characterization of an L2VPN that interconnects a set of sites
      from the customer's perspective.  The customer service model does
      not provide details on the service provider network.  The L2VPN
      customer service model is defined in [RFC8466].

   L2 VPN Service Network Model (L2NM):  Refers to the YANG module that
      describes an L2VPN service with a network-centric view.  It
      contains information of the service providers network and might
      include allocated resources.  Network controllers can use it to
      manage the Layer 2 VPN service configuration in the service
      providers network.  The YANG module can be consumed by a service
      orchestrator to request a VPN service to a network controller or
      to expose the list of active L2VPN services.

   Service orchestrator:  Refers to a functional entity that interacts
      with the customer of an L2VPN relying upon, e.g., L2SM.  The
      service orchestrator is responsible of the CE-PE attachment
      circuits, the PE selection, and requesting the activation of the
      L2VPN service to a network controller.

Internet-Draft                    L2NM                         July 2021


   Network controller:  Denotes a functional entity responsible for the
      management of the service providers network.

   VPN node:  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied on a PE and that belong to a single VPN service.  A VPN
      service involves one or more VPN nodes.  The VPN node will
      identify the service providers node on which the VPN is deployed.

   VPN network access:  Is an abstraction that represents the network
      interfaces that are associated to a given VPN node.  Traffic
      coming from the VPN network access belongs to the VPN.  The
      attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs are terminated
      in the VPN network access.

   VPN Service Provider (SP):  Is a service providers that offers L2VPN-
      related services.

   Service Provider Network (SP Network):  Is a network able to provide
      L2VPN-related services.

   figure into three separate functional components called "Service
   Orchestration", "Network Orchestration", and "Domain Orchestration".

   The reader may refer to [RFC8309] for the distinction between the
   "Customer Service Model", the "Service Delivery Model", the "Network
   Configuration Model", and the "Device Configuration Model".  The
   "Domain Orchestration" and "Config Manager" roles may be performed by
   "SDN Controllers".

   The customer may use various means to request a service that may
   trigger the instantiation of a L2NM.  The customer may use the L2SM
   or may rely upon more abstract models to request a service that
   relies upon an L3VPN service.  For example, the customer may supply
   an IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) [RFC7297], an enhanced
   VPN (VPN+) service [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], or an IETF network
   slice [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Note also that both the L2SM and the L2NM may be used in the context
   of the Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture
   [RFC8453].  Figure 2 shows the Customer Network Controller (CNC), the
   Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC), and the Provisioning Network
   Controller (PNC).

5.  Relation with other YANG Models

   The "ietf-vpn-common" module [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] includes a
   set of identities, types, and groupings that are meant to be reused
   by VPN-related YANG modules independently of the layer (e.g., Layer
   2, Layer 3) and the type of the module (e.g., network model, service



Barguil, et al.         Expires January 10, 2022                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    L2NM                         July 2021


   model) including future revisions of existing models (e.g.,
   [RFC8466]).  The L2NM reuses these common types and groupings.

   Also, the L2NM uses the IANA-maintained modules "iana-bgp-l2-encaps"
   (Section 7.1) and "iana-pseudowire-types" (Section 7.2) to identify a
   layer 2 encapsulation type.  Relying upon these IANA-maintained
   modules is meant to provide more flexibility in handling new types
   rather than be limited by a set of identities defined in the L2NM
   itself.

   As discussed in Section 4, the L2NM is meant to manage L2VPN services
   within a service provider network.  The module provides a network
   view of the service.  Such a view is only visible within the service
   provider and is not exposed outside (to customers, for example).  The
   following discusses how L2NM interfaces with other YANG modules:

   L2SM:  L2NM is not a customer service model.

      The internal view of the service (i.e., L2NM) may be mapped to an
      external view which is visible to customers: L2VPN Service YANG
      data Model (L2SM) [RFC8466].

      The L2NM can be fed with inputs that are requested by customers,
      typically, relying upon an L2SM template.  Concretely, some parts
      of the L2SM module can be directly mapped into L2NM while other
      parts are generated as a function of the requested service and
      local guidelines.  Finally, there are parts local to the service
      provider and do not map directly to L2SM.

      Note that the use of L2NM within a service provider does not
      assume nor preclude exposing the VPN service via the L2SM.  This
      is deployment-specific.  Nevertheless, the design of L2NM tries to
      align as much as possible with the features supported by the L2SM
      to ease grafting both L2NM and L2SM for the sake of highly
      automated VPN service provisioning and delivery.

   Network Topology Modules:  An L2VPN involves nodes that are part of a
      topology managed by the service provider network.  Such topology
      can be represented using the network topology module in [RFC8345].

   Device Modules:  L2NM is not a device model.

      Once a global VPN service is captured by means of the L2NM, the
      actual activation and provisioning of the VPN service will involve
      a variety of device modules to tweak the required functions for
      the delivery of the service.  These functions are supported by the
      VPN nodes and can be managed using device YANG modules.  A non-
      comprehensive list of such device YANG modules is provided below:

      *  Interfaces [RFC8343].

      *  BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

      *  ACLs [RFC8519].

      How the L2NM is used to derive device-specific actions is
      implementation-specific.

6.  Description of the L2NM YANG Module

   The L2NM ('ietf-l2vpn-ntw', Section 7.3) is meant to manage L2VPNs
   within a service provider network.  In particular, the 'ietf-l2vpn-
   ntw' module can be used to create, modify, and retrieve L2VPN
   services in a network controller.  The module is designed to minimize
   the amount of customer-related information.

   The full tree diagram of the module can be generated using the
   "pyang" tool [PYANG].  That tree is not included here because it is
   too long (Section 3.3 of [RFC8340]).  Instead, subtrees are provided
   for the reader's convenience.

6.1.  Overall Structure of the Module

   The 'ietf-l2vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers: 'vpn-services'
   and 'vpn-profiles' (see Figure 3).

   The 'vpn-profiles' container is used by the provider to maintain a
   set of common VPN profiles that apply to one or several VPN services
   (Section 6.2).

   The 'vpn-services' container maintains the set of L2VPN services
   managed in the service providers network.  The module allows to
   create a new L2VPN service by adding a new instance of 'vpn-service'.
   The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that abstracts the VPN
   Service.

                   Figure 3: Overall L2NM Tree Structure

6.2.  VPN Profiles

   The 'vpn-profiles' container (Figure 4) allows the VPN service
   provider to define and maintain a set of VPN profiles
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] that apply to one or several VPN
   services.

   This document does not make any assumption about the exact definition
   of these profiles.  The exact definition of the profiles is local to
   each VPN service provider.  The model only includes an identifier to
   these profiles in order to ease identifying and binding local
   policies when building a VPN service.  As shown in Figure 4, the
   following identifiers can be included:

   'external-connectivity-identifier':  This identifier refers to a
      profile that defines the external connectivity provided to a VPN
      service (or a subset of VPN sites).  An external connectivity may
      be an access to the Internet or a restricted connectivity such as
      access to a public/private cloud.

   'encryption-profile-identifier':  An encryption profile refers to a
      set of policies related to the encryption schemes and setup that
      can be applied when building and offering a VPN service.

   'qos-profile-identifier':  A Quality of Service (QoS) profile refers
      to as set of policies such as classification, marking, and actions
      (e.g., [RFC3644]).

   'bfd-profile-identifier':  A Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      profile refers to a set of BFD [RFC5880] policies that can be
      invoked when building a VPN service.

   'forwarding-profile-identifier':  A forwarding profile refers to the
      policies that apply to the forwarding of packets conveyed within a
      VPN.  Such policies may consist, for example, at applying Access
      Control Lists (ACLs).

   'routing-profile-identifier':  A routing profile refers to a set of
      routing policies that will be invoked (e.g., BGP policies) when
      delivering the VPN service.

6.3.  VPN Services

   The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that abstracts an L2VPN
   service in the service provider network.  Each 'vpn-service' is
   uniquely identified by an identifier: 'vpn-id'.  Such 'vpn-id' is
   only meaningful locally within the network controller.  The subtree
   of the 'vpn-services' is shown in Figure 5.

                      Figure 5: VPN Services Subtree

   The description of the VPN service data nodes that are depicted in
   Figure 5 are as follows:

   'vpn-id':  Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the
      L2VPN service within L2NM scope.

   'vpn-name':  Associates a name with the service in order to
      facilitate the identification of the service.

   'vpn-description':  Includes a textual description of the service.

      The internal structure of a VPN description is local to each VPN
      service provider.

Internet-Draft                    L2NM                         July 2021


   'customer-name':  Indicates the name of the customer who ordered the
      service.

   'parent-service-id':  Refers to an identifier of the parent service
      (e.g., L2SM, IETF network slice, VPN+) that triggered the creation
      of the L2VPN service.  This identifier is used to easily correlate
      the (network) service as built in the network with a service
      order.  A controller can use that correlation to enrich or
      populate some fields (e.g., description fields) as a function of
      local deployments.

   'vpn-type':  Indicates the L2VPN type.  The following types, defined
      in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], can be used for the L2NM:

      'vpls':  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) as defined in
         [RFC4761] or [RFC4762].

      'vpws':  Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) as defined in
         Section 3.1.1 of [RFC4664].

      'vpws-evpn':  VPWS as defined in [RFC8214].

      'pbb-evpn':  Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) EVPNs as defined in
         [RFC7623].

      'mpls-evpn':  MPLS-based EVPNs [RFC7432].

      'vxlan-evpn':  VXLAN based EVPNs [RFC8365].

      The type is used as a condition for the presence of some data
      nodes.

   'vpn-service-topology':  Indicates the network topology for the
      service: hub-spoke, any-to-any, or custom.

   'bgp-ad-enabled':  Controls whether BGP auto-discovery is enabled.
      If so, additional data nodes are included (Section 6.4.1).

   'signaling-type':  Indicates the signaling that is used for setting
      pseudowires.  Signaling type values are taken from
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  The following signaling options are
      supported:

      'bgp-signaling':  The L2NM supports two flavors of BGP-signaled
         L2VPNs:

         'l2vpn-bgp':  The service is a Multipoint VPLS that uses a BGP
            control plane as described in [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].

         'evpn-bgp':  The service is a Multipoint VPLS that uses also a
            BGP control plane, but also includes the additional features
            and related parameters [RFC7432] and [RFC7209].

      'ldp-signaling':  A Multipoint VPLS that uses a mesh of LDP-
         signaled Pseudowires [RFC6074].

      l2tp-signaling':  The L2NM uses L2TP-signaled Pseudowires as
         described in [RFC6074].

      Table 1 summarizes allowed signaling types for each VPN service
      type ('vpn-type').  See Section 6.4.2 for more details.

   'global-parameters-profiles':  Defines reusable parameters for the
      same L2VPN service.

      More details are provided in Section 6.3.1.

   'ethernet-segments':  Provides a set of data related to Ethernet
      Segment (ES).  This container is present only for EVPN-related
      L2VPN types.

      More details are provided in Section 6.3.2.

   'underlay-transport':  Describes the preference for the transport
      technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.  This
      preference is especially useful in networks with multiple domains
      and Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) types.  The underlay
      transport can be expressed as an abstract transport instance
      (e.g., an identifier of a VPN+ instance, a virtual network
      identifier, or a network slice name) or as an ordered list of the
      actual protocols to be enabled in the network.

      A rich set of protocol identifiers that can be used to refer to an
      underlay transport are defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   'status':  Is used to track the service status of a given VPN
      service.  Both operational and administrative status are
      maintained together with a timestamp.  For example, a service can
      be created, but not put into effect.

      Administrative and operational status can be used as a trigger to
      detect service anomalies.  For example, a service that is declared
      at the service layer as being active but still inactive at the
      network layer is an indication that network provision actions are
      needed to align the observed service status with the expected
      service status.

   'vpn-node':  Is an abstraction that represents a set of policies
      applied to a network node and that belong to a single 'vpn-
      service'.  An L2VPN service is typically built by adding instances
      of 'vpn-node' to the 'vpn-nodes' container.

      A 'vpn-node' contains 'vpn-network-accesses', which are the
      interfaces attached to the VPN by which the customer traffic is
      received.  Therefore, the customer sites are connected to the
      'vpn-network-accesses'.

      Note that, as this is a network data model, the information about
      customers sites is not required in the model.  Such information is
      rather relevant in the L2SM.  Whether that information is included
      in the L2NM, e.g., to populate the various 'description' data node
      is implementation-specific.

      More details are provided in Section 6.4.

   The 'global-parameters-profile' defines reusable parameters for the
   same L2VPN service instance ('vpn-service').  Global parameters
   profile are defined at the VPN service level and then called at the
   VPN node and VPN network access levels.  Each VPN instance profile is
   identified by 'profile-id'.  Some of the data nodes can be adjusted
   at the VPN node or VPN network access levels.  These adjusted values
   take precedence over the global ones.  The subtree of 'global-

               Figure 6: Global Parameters Profiles Subtree

   The description of the global parameters profile is as follows:

   'profile-id':  Uniquely identifies a global parameter profile.

   'rd':  As defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], these RD
      assignment modes are supported: direct assignment, automatic
      assignment from a given pool, automatic assignment, and no
      assignment.  For illustration purposes, the following modes can be
      used in the deployment cases:

      'directly-assigned':  The VPN service provider (service
         orchestrator) assigns explicitly RDs.

      'full-auto':  The network controller auto-assigns RDs.

      'no-rd':  The VPN service provider (service orchestrator)
         explicitly wants no RD to be assigned.

      Also, the module accommodates deployments where only the Assigned
      Number subfield of RDs is assigned from a pool while the
      Administrator subfield is set to, e.g., the Router ID that is
      assigned to a VPN node.  The module supports these modes for
      managing the Assigned Number subfield: explicit assignment, auto-
      assignment from a pool, and full auto-assignment.

   'vpn-targets':  Specifies RT import/export rules for the VPN service.

   'local-autonomous-system':  Indicates the Autonomous System Number
      (ASN) that is configured for the VPN node.  The ASN can be used to
      auto-derive some other attributes such as RDs or Ethernet Segment
      Identifiers (ESIs).

   'svc-mtu':  Is the service MTU for an L2VPN service.  It is also
      known as the maximum transmission unit or maximum frame size.

Internet-Draft                    L2NM                         July 2021


      When a frame is larger than the MTU, it is fragmented to
      accommodate the MTU of the network.

   'ce-vlan-preservation':  Is set to preserve the CE-VLAN ID from
      ingress to egress, i.e., CE-VLAN tag of the egress frame are
      identical to those of the ingress frame that yielded this egress
      service frame.  If All-to-One bundling within a site is enabled,
      then preservation applies to all ingress service frames.  If All-
      to-One bundling is disabled, then preservation applies to tagged
      Ingress service frames having CE-VLAN ID 1 through 4094.

   'ce-vlan-cos-perservation':  Controls the CE VLAN CoS preservation.
      When set, PCP bits in the CE-VLAN tag of the egress frame are
      identical to those of the ingress frame that yielded this egress
      service frame.

   'control-word-negotiation':  Controls whether control-word
      negotiation is enabled (if set to true) or not (if set to false).
      Refer to Section 7 of [RFC8077] for more details.

   'mac-policies':  Includes a set of MAC policies that apply to the
      service:

      'mac-addr-limit':  Is a container of MAC address limit
         configuration.  It includes the following data nodes:

         'mac-num-limit':  Maximum number of MAC addresses learned from
            the customer for a single service instance.

         'time-interval':  The aging time of the mac address.

         'action':  Specifies the action when the upper limit is
            exceeded: drop the packet, flood the packet, or simply send
            a warning log message.

      'mac-loop-prevention':  Container for MAC loop prevention.

         'window':  The timer when a MAC mobility event is detected.

         'frequency':  The number of times to detect MAC duplication,
            where a 'duplicate MAC address' situation has occurred and
            the duplicate MAC address has been added to a list of
            duplicate MAC addresses.

         'retry-timer':  The retry timer.  When the retry timer expires,
            the duplicate MAC address will be flushed from the MAC-VRF.

         'protection-type':  It defines the protection type

Internet-Draft                    L2NM                         July 2021


   multicast-like':  Controls whether multicast is allowed in the
      service.

6.3.2.  Ethernet Segments

   The 'ethernet-segments' container is used to list a set of ESes that
   are defined in an EVPN service.  In reference to the structure shown
   in Figure 7, the following data nodes can be included:

   'name':  Sets a name to uniquely identify an ES.  This name is called
      in the VPN network access level to handle multi-homing, for
      example.

   'esi-type':  Indicates the ESI type as discussed in Section 5 of
      [RFC7432].  ESI can be automatically assigned either with or
      without indicating a pool from which the ESI should be taken.  The
      following types are supported:

      'esi-type-0':  The ESI is directly configured by the operator.

      'esi-type-1':  The ESI is auto-generated from the IEEE 802.1AX
         Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) [IEEE802.1AX].

      'esi-type-2':  The ESI is auto-generated and determined based on
         the Layer 2 bridge protocol.

      'esi-type-3':  The ESI is a MAC-based ESI value that can be auto-
         generated or configured by the operator.

      'esi-type-4':  The ESI is auto-generated or configured by the
         operator based on the Router-ID.  The 'router-id' supplied in
         Section 6.4 can be used to auto-derive an ESI when this type is
         used.

      'esi-type-5':  The ESI is auto-generated or configured by the
         operator based on the Autonomous System (AS) number.  The
         'local-autonomous-system' supplied in Section 6.3.1 can be used
         to auto-derive an ESI when this type is used.

   'esi-redundancy-mode':  Specifies the EVPN redundancy mode for a
      given ES.  The following modes are supported: Single-Active
      (Section 14.1.1 of [RFC7432]) or All-Active (Section 14.1.2 of
      [RFC7432]).

   'df-election':  Specifies a set of parameters related to the
      Designated Forwarder (DF) election (Section 8.5 of [RFC7432]).
      For example, this data node can be used to indicate an election
      method (e.g., [RFC8584] or [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-pref-df]).  If no

      election method is indicated, the default one defined in
      Section 8.5 of [RFC7432] is used.

   'split-horizon-filtering':  Controls the activation of the split-
      horizon filtering for an ES (Section 8.3 of [RFC7432]).

   In reference to the subtree shown in Figure 8, the description of VPN
   node data nodes is as follows:

   'vpn-node-id':  Is an identifier that uniquely identifies a node that
      enables a VPN network access.

   'description':  Provides a textual description of the VPN node.

   'ne-id':  Includes a unique identifier of the network element where
      the VPN node is deployed.

   'router-id':  Indicates a 32-bit number that is used to uniquely
      identify a router within an Autonomous System.

   'active-global-parameters-profiles':  Lists the set of active global
      VPN parameters profiles for this VPN node.  Concretely, one or
      more global profiles that are defined at the VPN service level can
      be activated at the VPN node level; each of these profiles is
      uniquely identified by means of 'profile-id'.  The structure of
      'active-global-parameters-profiles' uses the same data nodes as
      Section 6.3.1 except RD and RT related data nodes.

      Values defined in 'active-global-parameters-profiles' overrides
      the ones defined in the VPN service level.

   'signaling-option':  See Section 6.4.2.

   'status':  Tracks the status of a node involved in a VPN service.
      Both operational and administrative status are maintained.  A
      mismatch between the administrative status vs. the operational
      status can be used as a trigger to detect anomalies.

   'vpn-network-accesses':  Represents the point to which sites are
      connected.

      Note that, unlike in L2SM, the L2NM does not need to model the
      customer site, only the points where the traffic from the site are
      received (i.e., the PE side of PE-CE connections).  Hence, the VPN
      network access contains the connectivity information between the
      provider's network and the customer premises.  The VPN profiles
      ('vpn-profiles') have a set of routing policies that can be
      applied during the service creation.

      See Section 6.5 for more details.

6.4.1.  BGP Auto-Discovery

   'bgp-auto-discovery' container (Figure 9) includes the required
   information for the activation of BGP auto-discovery
   [RFC4761][RFC6624].  As discussed in Section 1 of [RFC6624], all of
   BGP-based methods include the notion of a VPN identifier that serves
   to unify components of a given VPN and the concept of auto-discovery;
   hence the support of the data node 'vpn-id'.

   For the particular case of EVPN, the L2NM supports RT auto-derivation
   based on the Ethernet Tag ID specified in Section 7.10.1 of
   [RFC7432].  An operator can enable/disable this functionality by
   means of 'auto-rt-enable'.  The asigned RT can be retrieved using
   'auto-route-target'.

   For all BGP-based L2VPN flavors, other data nodes such as RD and RT
   are used.  These data nodes have the same structure as the one
   discussed in Section 6.3.1.

6.4.2.  Signaling Option

   The 'signaling-option' container (Figure 10) defines a set of data
   nodes for a given signaling protocol that is used for an L2VPN
   service.  As discussed in Section 6.3, several signaling options to
   exchange membership information between PEs of an L2VPN are
   supported.  The signaling type to be used for an L2VPN service is the
   controlled at the VPN service level by means of 'signaling-type'.

                Figure 10: Signaling Option Overall Subtree

   The following signaling data nodes are supported:

   'mtu':  Sets the MTU to advertise for a PW (e.g., Section 5.1 of
      [RFC6624] or Section 6.1 of [RFC4762]).

   'mtu-allow-mismatch':  When set to true, it allows MTU mismatch for a
      PW (see, e.g., Section 4.3 of [RFC4667]).

   'type':  Indicates the signaling type.  This type inherits the value
      of 'signaling-type' defined at the service level (Section 6.3).

   'bgp':  Is provided when BGP is used for L2VPN signaling.  The
      structure of the BGP-related data nodes is provided in Figure 11.

      As discussed in Section 2.2.2 of [RFC6624], a CE ID ('ce-id')
      identifying the CE within the VPN must be provided.  Remote CEs
      that are entitled to connect to the same VPN should fit with the
      CE range ('ce-range') as discussed in Section 2.2.3 of [RFC6624].
      'pw-encapsulation-type' is used to control the PW encapsulation
      type (Section 3 of [RFC6624]).  The value of the 'pw-
      encapsulation-type' are taken from the IANA-maintained "iana-bgp-
      l2-encaps" module.

      For the specific case of VPLS, the VPLS Edge ID (VE ID, 'vpls-
      edge-id') and a VE ID range ('vpls-edge-id-range') are provided as
      per Section 3.2 of [RFC4761].

   'ldp':  The model supports the configuration of the parameters that
      are discussed in Section 6 of [RFC4762].  Such parameters include
      a an Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) (a.k.a., VPLS-id), a Source
      Attachment Individual Identifier (SAII), a list of peers that are
      associated with a Target Attachment Individual Identifier (TAII),
      a PW type, and a PW description, (Figure 12).  Unlike BGP, only
      Ethernet and Ethernet tagged mode are supported.  The AGI, SAII,
      and TAII are encoded following the types defined in Section 3.4 of
      [RFC4446].

   'l2tp':  The model supports the configuration of the parameters that
      are discussed in Section 4 of [RFC4667].  Such parameters include
      a router-id that is used to uniquely identify a PE, a PW type, an
      AGI, an SAII, and a list of peers that are associated with a TAII
      (Figure 13).  The PW type ('pseudowire-type') value is taken from
      the IANA-maintained "iana-pseudowire-types" module.

6.5.  VPN Network Access

   A 'vpn-network-access' represents an entry point to a VPN service .
   In other words, this container encloses the parameters that describe
   the access information for the traffic that belongs to a particular
   L2VPN.  As such, every 'vpn-network-access' MUST belong to one and
   only one 'vpn-node'.

   A 'vpn-network-access' includes information such as the connection on
   which the access is defined , the specific layer 2 service
   requirements, etc.

   The VPN network access is comprised of:

   'id':  Includes an identifier of the VPN network access.

   'description':  Includes a textual description of the VPN network
      access.

   'port-id':  Indicates the port on which the VPN network access is
      bound.

   ' global-parameters-profile':  Provides a pointer to an active
      'global-parameters-profile' at the VPN node level.  Referencing an
      active 'global-parameters-profile' implies that all associated
      data nodes will be inherited by the VPN network access.  However,
      some of the inherited data nodes (e.g., ACL policies) can be
      refined at the VPN network access level.  In such case, refined
      values take precedence over inherited ones.

   'status':  Indicates the administrative and operational status of the
      service.

   'connection':  Represents and groups the set of Layer 2 connectivity
      from where the traffic of the L2VPN in a particular VPN Network
      access is coming.  See Section 6.5.1.

   'vpws-service-instance':  Includes a set of data nodes that are
      required for the configuration of a VPWS-EVPN [RFC8214].  See
      Section 6.5.2.

   'group':  Is used for grouping VPN network accesses by assigning the
      same identifier to these accesses.  The precedence attribute is
      used to differentiate the primary and secondary accesses for a
      service with multiple accesses.  An example to illustrate the use
      of this container for redundancy purposes is provided in
      Appendix A.1.  This container is also used to identify the link of
      an ES by allocating the same ESI.  An example to illustrate this
      functionality is provided in Appendices A.3 and A.4.

   'ethernet-service-oam':  Carries information about the service OAM.
      See Section 6.5.3.

   'service':  Specifies the service parameters (e.g., QoS, multicast)
      to apply for a given VPN network access.  See Section 6.5.4.

6.5.1.  Connection

   The 'connection' container (Figure 15) is used to configure the
   relevant properties of the interface to which the L2VPN instance is
   attached to (e.g., encapsulation type, lag interfaces, split-
   horizon).  The L2NM supports tag manipulation operations (e.g., tag
   rewrite).

   Note that the 'connection' container does not include the physical-
   specific configuration as this is assumed to be directly handled
   using device modules (e.g., interfaces module).  Moreover, this
   design is also meant to avoid manipulated global parameters at the
   service level and lower the risk of impacting other services sharing
   the same physical interface.

   Section 5.3.2.2.6 of [RFC8466] for OAM matters.

   The description of the service data nodes is as follows:

   'mtu':  Specifies the MTU for the VPN network access.

   'svc-input-bandwidth' and 'svc-output-bandwidth':  Specify the
      service bandwidth for the L2VPN service.  It can be represented
      using the Committed Information Rate (CIR), the Excess Information
      Rate (EIR), or the Peak Information Rate (PIR).  As shown in
      Figure 19, the structure of service bandwidth data nodes is
      inherited from the L2SM [RFC8466].  The following types, defined
      in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], can be used to indicate the
      bandwidth type:

      'bw-per-cos':  The bandwidth is per Class of Service (CoS).

      'bw-per-port':  The bandwidth is per VPN network access.

      'bw-per-site':  The bandwidth is to all VPN network accesses that
         belong to the same site.

      'bw-per-service':  The bandwidth is per L2VPN service.

      'svc-input-bandwidth' indicates the inbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., download bandwidth from the service provider to
      the site).

      'svc-output-bandwidth' indicates the outbound bandwidth of the
      connection (i.e., upload bandwidth from the site to the service
      provider).

   QoS  Is used to define a set of QoS policies to apply on a given VPN
      network access (Figure 20).  The QoS classification can be based
      on many criteria such as source MAC address, destination MAC
      address, etc.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] . The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in "ietf-l2vpn-ntw" YANG
   module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true,
   which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) and delete operations to these data nodes without proper
   protection or authentication can have a negative effect on network
   operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability in the "ietf-l2vpn-ntw" module:

   o  'vpn-service': An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
      undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L2VPN
      service, interrupting all the traffic of a client.  In addition,
      an attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g.,
      QoS, bandwidth), leading to malfunctioning of the service and
      therefore to SLA violations.  In addition, an attacker could
      attempt to create an L2VPN service or adding a new network access.
      Such activity can be detected by adequately monitoring and
      tracking network configuration changes.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the "ietf-l2vpn-ntw" YANG module
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via
   get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the
   subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  'customer-name' and 'ip-connection': An attacker can retrieve
      privacy-related information which can be used to track a customer.
      Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of
      the customer-provider trust relationship.

   The following summarizes the foreseen risks of using the "ietf-l2vpn-
   ntw" module can be classified into:

   o  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify VPN services.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a VPN
      service.

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to read VPN service related
      information.

   Both "iana-bgp-l2-encaps" and "iana-pseudowire-types" modules define
   YANG identities for encapsulation/pseudowires types.  These
   identities are intended to be referenced by other YANG modules, and
   by themselves do not expose any nodes which are writable, contain
   read-only state, or RPCs.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  YANG Modules

   This document requests IANA to register the following URIs in the
   "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-bgp-l2-encaps
         Registrant Contact: The IESG.
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-pseudowire-types
         Registrant Contact: The IESG.
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG modules in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry:

9.2.  BGP Layer 2 Encapsulation Types

   This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
   "iana-bgp-l2-encaps" YANG module.  IANA is requested to add this note
   for both modules:

      BGP Layer 2 encapsulation types must not be directly added to the
      "iana-bgp-l2-encaps" YANG module.  They must instead be
      respectively added to the "BGP Layer 2 Encapsulation Types"
      registry [IANA-BGP-L2].

   When a Layer 2 encapsulation type is added to the "BGP Layer 2
   Encapsulation Types" registry, a new "identity" statement must be
   added to the "iana-bgp-l2-encaps" YANG module.  The name of the
   "identity" is the lower-case of encapsulation name provided in the
   description.  The "identity" statement should have the following sub-
   statements defined:

   "base":        Contains 'bgp-l2-encaps-type'.

   "description": Replicates the description from the registry.

   "reference":   Replicates the reference from the registry and add the
                  title of the document.

   Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.

   When the "iana-bgp-l2-encaps" YANG module is updated, a new
   "revision" statement must be added in front of the existing revision
   statements.

   IANA is requested to add this note to [IANA-BGP-L2]:

      When this registry is modified, the YANG module "iana-bgp-
      l2-encaps" must be updated as defined in RFCXXXX.

9.3.  Pseudowire Types

   This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
   "iana-pseudowire-types" YANG module.  IANA is requested to add this
   note for both modules:

      MPLS pseudowire types must not be directly added to the "iana-bgp-
      l2-encaps" YANG module.  They must instead be respectively added
      to the "MPLS Pseudowire Types" registry [IANA-PW-Types].

   When a pseudowire type is added to the "iana-pseudowire-types"
   registry, a new "identity" statement must be added to the "iana-
   pseudowire-types" YANG module.  The name of the "identity" is the
   lower-case of encapsulation name provided in the description.  The
   "identity" statement should have the following sub-statements
   defined:

   "base":        Contains 'iana-pw-types'.

   "description": Replicates the description from the registry.

   "reference":   Replicates the reference from the registry and add the
                  title of the document.

   Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.

   When the "iana-pseudowire-types" YANG module is updated, a new
   "revision" statement must be added in front of the existing revision
   statements.

   IANA is requested to add this note to [IANA-PW-Types]:

      When this registry is modified, the YANG module "iana-pseudowire-
      types" must be updated as defined in RFCXXXX.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section includes a non-exhaustive list of examples to illustrate
   the use of the L2NM.

   In the following subsections, only the content of the message bodies
   is shown using JSON notations [RFC7951].

   The examples use the folding defined in [RFC8792] for long lines.

A.1.  VPN Network Access Precedence

   In reference to the example depicted in Figure 23, an L2VPN service
   involves two VPN network accesses to sites that belong to the same
   customer.

   +--------------+
   |VPN-NODE      |
   |           +--+-------+
   |           | NET-ACC-2| Primacy
   |           |          +------------------
   |           +--+-------+
   |              |
   |           +--+-------+
   |           | NET-ACC-1| Backup
   |           |          +------------------
   |           +--+-------+
   |              |
   +--------------+

            Figure 23: Example of Multiple VPN Network Accesses

   In order to tag one of these VPN network accesses as "primary" and
   the other one as "backup", Figure 24 shows an excerpt of the
   corresponding L2NM configuration.  In such as configuration, both
   accesses are bound to the same "group-id" and the "precedence" data
   node set as function of the intended role of each access (primary or
   backup).

A.2.  BGP-based VPLS

   This section provides an example to illustrate how the L2NM can be
   used to mange BGP-based VPLS.  We consider the sample VPLS service
   delivered using the architecture depicted in Figure 25.  In
   accordance with [RFC4761], we assume that a full mesh is established
   between all PEs.  The details about such full mesh are not detailed
   here.

   Figure 26 show an example of a message body used to configured a VPLS
   instance using the L2NM.  In this example, BGP is used for both auto-
   discovery and signaling.

   Figure 26: Example of L2NM Message Body to Configure a BGP-based VPLS

A.3.  EVPN-VPWS Service Instance

   Figure 27 depictes a sample architecture to offer VPWS-EVPN service
   between CE1 and CE2.  Both CEs are multi-homed.  BGP sessions are
   maintained between these PEs as per [RFC8214].  In this EVPN
   instance, an All-Active redundancy mode is used.

             Figure 29: An Example of Automatic ESI Assignment

   Figure 30 shows how the L2NM is used to instruct both PE1 and PE2 to
   auto-assign the ESI to identify the ES used with CE1.  In this
   example, we suppose that LACP is enabled and that a Type 1 (T=0x01)
   is used as per Section 5 of [RFC7432].  Note that this example does
   not include all the details to configure the EVPN service, but
   focuses only on the ESI management part.

A.5.  BGP-based VPWS with LDP Signaling

   Let's consider the simple architecture depicted in Figure 32 to offer
   a VPWS between CE1 and CE2.  The service uses BGP for auto-discovery
   and LDP for signaling.

                            with LDP Signaling

Appendix B.  LDP-based VPLS

   This section provides an example to illustrate how the L2NM can be
   used to manage a VPLS with LDP signaling.  The connectivity between
   the CE and the PE is direct using Dot1q encapsulation.  We consider
   the sample service delivered using the architecture depicted in
   Figure 34.

                  Figure 34: An Example of VPLS topology

   Figure 35 shows how the L2NM is used to instruct both PE1 and PE2 to
   use the targeted LDP session between them to establish the VPLS
   "1543" between the ends.  A single VPN service is created for this
   purpose.  Additionally, two VPN Nodes and each with a corresponding
   VPN network access is also created.
